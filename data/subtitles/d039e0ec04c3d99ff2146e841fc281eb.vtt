you should not go.

- I'm not Ann anymore.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.714

never see me again.

Kai Proctor.

- There's not a criminal enterprise around

here that doesn't start or end
in his pocket.

00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:20.349

- Yeah.

- Hello.
- Sheriff Hood?

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.257
Yeah, this is Hood.

No, he doesn't know. He can't.

00:01:55.628 --> 00:01:58.562
By the time he figures out
we're not coming back,

00:01:58.597 --> 00:02:00.731
we'll be long gone.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.140
Hey.

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.744
We risk our lives
every time we steal for him.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.780
Why not risk our lives for us?

00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:23.183
No one's ever
stolen from Rabbit.

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:27.053
He doesn't know.

00:02:37.462 --> 00:02:40.197
Everything will be fine.

in Banshee,
our young mayor among them,

00:13:40.036 --> 00:13:42.437
who would have been happy
to see me go down.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.441
Yeah, why is that?

00:13:45.475 --> 00:13:46.976
Oh...

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.246
some people find my business
practices a little aggressive.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.248
I don't deny it.

00:13:52.282 --> 00:13:54.517
Not everyone shares
my vision for this town.

00:13:54.552 --> 00:13:57.187
But that's a talk
for another time.

00:13:57.221 --> 00:14:01.624
The reason I stopped in is to warn
you about the Moody brothers.

00:14:01.659 --> 00:14:03.593
Warn me?

00:14:03.627 --> 00:14:06.562
Yeah, they might be swimming in
the shallow end of the gene pool,

00:14:06.597 --> 00:14:08.598
but they're a fiercely
loyal clan.

00:14:08.632 --> 00:14:11.168
Been in this town
almost as long as my people.

00:14:11.202 --> 00:14:12.903
And they will be out for blood.

00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:16.372
I'll keep my eye out.

00:14:17.541 --> 00:14:20.110
Sheriff, I wouldn't
be bothering you

00:14:20.144 --> 00:14:23.013
if I didn't think you have a
serious problem on your hands.

00:14:23.047 --> 00:14:24.581
I don't deny your abilities.

00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:28.084
It's just that your hands
are tied by this office,

00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:31.755
whereas I have a talent
for resolving problems

00:14:31.789 --> 00:14:34.124
like this one quietly.

00:14:37.828 --> 00:14:40.497
I appreciate your concern,

00:14:40.531 --> 00:14:43.266
but...

00:14:43.301 --> 00:14:46.404
I think I'll just take
things as they come.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.042
It could be that I'm speaking
globally here, Sheriff,

00:14:52.076 --> 00:14:54.611
beyond the Moody situation.

00:14:54.646 --> 00:14:57.981
You see, I've got a good number
of local business interests

00:14:58.048 --> 00:15:00.516
that need to be kept
running smoothly.

00:15:00.551 --> 00:15:03.920
These interests can occasionally
generate difficulties,

00:15:03.954 --> 00:15:07.789
but they also
generate revenues.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:10.158
Significant revenues.

00:15:11.527 --> 00:15:14.329
What do you want, Mr. Proctor?

00:15:15.699 --> 00:15:19.169
I might ask you the same
question, Sheriff Hood.

00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:27.511
I'm good.

00:15:30.715 --> 00:15:33.116
But thank you.

00:15:40.225 --> 00:15:42.493
You take care of that.

00:15:42.527 --> 00:15:45.963
It could go bad pretty fast.

00:16:09.121 --> 00:16:10.521
<i>( waves crashing )</i>

00:16:10.555 --> 00:16:12.590
<i>( ring tone playing )</i>

00:16:14.926 --> 00:16:17.293
( gulls screeching )

00:16:19.463 --> 00:16:21.530
( ring tone continues )

00:16:23.033 --> 00:16:25.101
- Where's my fucking money?
- Lucas: <i>You'll get it.</i>

00:16:25.135 --> 00:16:27.970
- Where'd you land?
- <i>In hell.</i>

00:16:28.004 --> 00:16:31.206
Do you have any idea
what I'm surrounded by?

00:16:31.274 --> 00:16:33.175
Skee-fucking-Ball,

00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:34.876
cotton-fucking-candy,

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:37.446
and sea-fucking-gulls.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.315
Is that a cape?

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.786
This is Diane von
Furstenberg, chica.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.553
Shoo. Go get pregnant.

00:16:48.024 --> 00:16:51.626
- So?
- <i>Bitch, you got lucky on this one.</i>

00:16:51.661 --> 00:16:55.597
Lucas Hood had virtually
no living relatives,

00:16:55.632 --> 00:16:58.066
an estranged ex-wife
and son he ain't seen in years.

00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.335
<i>I couldn't even find</i>
<i>any close friends.</i>

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.271
And he ain't into
the grid, neither.

00:17:02.305 --> 00:17:04.039
No Facebook, no Twitter.

00:17:04.073 --> 00:17:06.508
Your cover is good for now.

00:17:06.576 --> 00:17:08.710
<i>Except...</i>

00:17:08.745 --> 00:17:10.212
Except what?

00:17:10.247 --> 00:17:11.981
Except that being where you are

00:17:12.015 --> 00:17:14.917
makes you the dumbest
bitch that I know!

00:17:14.952 --> 00:17:17.086
Oh, not you, Snooki.

00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:24.628
So, how's she look?

00:17:27.532 --> 00:17:29.599
She looks good.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.057
( grunts )

00:18:20.118 --> 00:18:22.219
- Hold it!
- ( Shouts )

00:18:23.455 --> 00:18:26.123
Sorry, it's been
that kind of week.

00:18:26.158 --> 00:18:28.626
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.561
Then let's have some fun.

00:18:30.596 --> 00:18:33.498
( grunting )

00:18:42.174 --> 00:18:44.942
You and your Hula Poppers.

00:18:44.977 --> 00:18:47.912
If you're after serious game,
you'd better come ready.

00:18:47.946 --> 00:18:49.514
Live bait is the way to go.

00:18:49.548 --> 00:18:52.650
Nah. I've been winning
fishing derbies

00:18:52.685 --> 00:18:55.420
since you were
a speck of sperm.

00:18:55.454 --> 00:18:59.057
I hear you have the new sheriff
living over your garage.

00:19:00.659 --> 00:19:04.696
Huh? Seems kind of strange for
an ex-con renting to a lawman.

00:19:06.499 --> 00:19:08.933
Doesn't it bother you?

00:19:08.968 --> 00:19:12.537
Apparently not as much
as it bothers you.

00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:16.441
At some point, I might begin
to question your loyalty.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:22.313
No, I'm just
a broken-down ex-con.

00:19:22.348 --> 00:19:25.217
I don't choose sides.

00:19:27.921 --> 00:19:30.322
Kai.

00:19:30.356 --> 00:19:34.259
You talk about serious game?

00:19:34.293 --> 00:19:37.062
Hood is serious game.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.131
<i>Like you've never seen.</i>

00:19:39.166 --> 00:19:42.801
So if you come for him,
you'd better come ready.

00:19:47.207 --> 00:19:49.408
Take care of yourself, Sugar.

00:19:50.477 --> 00:19:52.378
Yeah, you, too.

00:19:52.412 --> 00:19:54.546
<i>( jukebox playing )</i>

00:20:04.424 --> 00:20:07.593
No, no, no. You can't
be here tonight.

00:20:07.661 --> 00:20:09.629
And yet I am.

00:20:09.663 --> 00:20:11.164
Cole Moody's wake.

00:20:11.198 --> 00:20:13.833
<i>His brothers</i>
<i>are drunker than usual,</i>

00:20:13.867 --> 00:20:15.335
if that's possible.

00:20:15.369 --> 00:20:16.869
Now, we've already
had two fistfights.

00:20:16.904 --> 00:20:18.571
That's just between
family members.

00:20:18.605 --> 00:20:20.974
Can I at least get a sandwich?
Hey.

00:20:21.008 --> 00:20:23.043
All right.

00:20:23.077 --> 00:20:25.212
All right, just...

00:20:27.982 --> 00:20:29.816
Whatever it takes
to get you out of here.

00:20:29.851 --> 00:20:31.451
Look, here. Come on, take 'em.

00:20:31.486 --> 00:20:34.688
Come on, eat 'em. Plenty
more where that came from.

00:20:34.723 --> 00:20:36.656
Come on.

00:20:36.691 --> 00:20:38.992
All right?

00:20:39.027 --> 00:20:41.428
- ( sighs )
- <i>( Door opens )</i>

00:20:42.796 --> 00:20:44.631
<i>( door closes )</i>

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.021
Sheriff Hood.

00:21:10.055 --> 00:21:12.156
Yeah?

00:21:15.127 --> 00:21:17.162
You don't know
who I am, do you?

00:21:17.196 --> 00:21:18.730
Not yet.

00:21:18.764 --> 00:21:21.165
I'm Kat Moody.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.901
You killed my husband.

00:21:22.935 --> 00:21:25.937
And now you're
sitting here eating food

00:21:25.971 --> 00:21:29.074
prepared for his wake,
food that I paid for.

00:21:31.511 --> 00:21:34.747
Well, I apologize
about the food.

00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:37.516
That was in bad taste.

00:21:37.551 --> 00:21:40.353
But not for killing my husband?

00:21:41.722 --> 00:21:43.890
( chuckles )

00:21:43.925 --> 00:21:46.527
He smashed me
in the head with a pipe

00:21:46.561 --> 00:21:48.595
and then fired a gun
at a crowded party.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.965
So, while I am sorry
for your grief...

00:21:55.036 --> 00:21:57.971
He laid a good one on you.

00:21:58.038 --> 00:21:59.839
He did.

00:22:04.378 --> 00:22:06.612
You're the second
woman to hit me today.

00:22:06.646 --> 00:22:08.414
I bet that's
a slow day for you.

00:22:08.448 --> 00:22:10.816
- Mmm.
- <i>( Gun cocks )</i>

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.019
Kat: <i>Jesus Christ.</i>
<i>Marcus, Dex, put those away.</i>

00:22:14.054 --> 00:22:15.988
Shut up, Kat, and get inside.

00:22:16.022 --> 00:22:19.792
You Moody boys sure do
like your six-shooters.

00:22:19.826 --> 00:22:21.860
You got permits for those?

00:22:21.895 --> 00:22:23.696
You won't be around
long enough to find out.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.564
You're not gonna shoot a man
at your brother's wake.

00:22:25.599 --> 00:22:27.032
What the hell
is wrong with you?

00:22:27.067 --> 00:22:28.834
We're doing this for Cole.

00:22:28.868 --> 00:22:31.103
Cole was a mean drunk
and he got what was coming.

00:22:31.137 --> 00:22:33.172
You watch your mouth, bitch.
I'll kill you, too.

00:22:33.206 --> 00:22:36.008
Hey, you're Marcus, right?
And you're Dex?

00:22:36.042 --> 00:22:37.543
That's right.

00:22:37.577 --> 00:22:40.312
Okay, Marcus, Dex,

00:22:40.347 --> 00:22:43.215
- you have the right to remain silent.
- That's far enough.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.818
Anything you do say can be used
against you in a court of law.

00:22:45.852 --> 00:22:48.254
- You believe the balls on this guy?
- He thinks he's arresting us.

00:22:48.288 --> 00:22:50.489
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Shut the fuck up.

00:22:50.524 --> 00:22:52.525
Why don't you make me?

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.461
Come on.

00:22:58.999 --> 00:23:01.333
Marcus, Dex,

00:23:01.368 --> 00:23:03.502
your coffee is getting cold.

00:23:03.537 --> 00:23:05.805
This don't concern you, Sugar.

00:23:05.839 --> 00:23:08.574
All the same, I am concerned.

00:23:08.609 --> 00:23:11.277
Come on.

00:23:16.116 --> 00:23:18.317
Hmm?

00:23:21.487 --> 00:23:23.956
If you can't afford
an attorney,

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:27.125
the court will appoint one for
you, and he'll probably suck.

00:23:27.159 --> 00:23:29.994
Sheriff Hood, they're drunk
and they're morons,

00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:32.296
but they're grieving
in their own way.

00:23:39.538 --> 00:23:42.373
Get the fuck out of here.

00:23:43.775 --> 00:23:45.876
Go on.

00:23:48.013 --> 00:23:50.981
This isn't over, Hood.
We'll be looking out for you.

00:23:51.016 --> 00:23:53.518
Well, I'll be the one in the
car with the flashing lights.

00:23:58.257 --> 00:24:00.158
( laughs )

00:24:00.192 --> 00:24:02.494
What the fuck
are you looking at?

00:24:10.303 --> 00:24:11.903
And you are?

00:24:55.617 --> 00:24:58.419
( moaning )

00:25:19.643 --> 00:25:21.844

<i>( dogs barking )</i>

00:26:14.998 --> 00:26:16.598
Let's go.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.136
Hey, stick to the trees for at
least two miles. You'll be fine.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.604
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

00:26:22.638 --> 00:26:24.673
- I'm gonna throw them off.
- No, I'm not leaving you!

00:26:24.707 --> 00:26:26.241
Listen to me.
You were right about Rabbit.

00:26:26.275 --> 00:26:28.476
- He knew. He knew.
- Don't do this.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.712
Don't do this. Don't do this.
We can make it.

00:26:30.746 --> 00:26:32.380
Hey, hey! I'll catch up to you.

00:26:32.414 --> 00:26:34.682
I love you. I love you.

00:26:34.717 --> 00:26:37.018
- <i>( siren wailing )</i>
- Take the diamonds.

00:26:37.053 --> 00:26:39.354
- I'll catch up to you.
- <i>( Police radio chatter )</i>

00:26:39.388 --> 00:26:40.955
Go!

Officer: <i>Right there!</i>

00:26:43.892 --> 00:26:46.160
<i>No! I got you!</i>

00:26:46.194 --> 00:26:47.795
- <i>Stay right where you are.</i>

00:26:47.796 --> 00:26:49.396
- Officer #2: <i>Get down
on the ground right now.</i>

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.433
- Right there. Hands up. Don't do it...
- ( Grunting )

00:26:52.467 --> 00:26:54.435
Come on.

00:26:54.469 --> 00:26:56.471
- <i>( helicopter whirring )</i>
- Officer: Copy. We got him.

00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:03.946
Baby!

00:27:08.152 --> 00:27:10.286
Hey.

00:27:12.223 --> 00:27:14.224
You okay, baby?

00:27:14.258 --> 00:27:16.393
Yeah.

00:27:21.299 --> 00:27:23.400
Just a bad dream.

Is that the Moody report?

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:41.987
Yeah.

00:27:42.021 --> 00:27:43.855
It's supposed to be.

00:27:46.726 --> 00:27:48.894
But if I had known
there was all this paperwork,

00:27:48.928 --> 00:27:50.729
I never would have shot him.

00:27:50.797 --> 00:27:53.631
Aw, come on, you must have had
to do this back in Oregon.

00:27:53.666 --> 00:27:56.634
Uh, yeah, I wasn't
any better at it then.

00:27:57.903 --> 00:28:00.405
You filled out
the incident report twice.

00:28:00.439 --> 00:28:02.640
And you have to attach it
to the SO sheet.

00:28:03.776 --> 00:28:07.411
- SO?
- State oversight.

00:28:07.446 --> 00:28:11.282
Have you already done
the weapons discharge form?

00:28:19.023 --> 00:28:21.225
Uh, you know,

00:28:21.259 --> 00:28:25.029
Sheriff Morgan used to have
Alma do all this stuff for him.

00:28:25.063 --> 00:28:27.765
She enjoys it. Just buy her
a nice bottle of wine.

00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:30.500
Look it over when she's done.

00:28:31.869 --> 00:28:33.603
Sold.

00:28:39.677 --> 00:28:42.078
You gave us your word that
you'd stop ditching school.

00:28:42.112 --> 00:28:44.147
- My grades are fine.
- That is not the point.

00:28:44.181 --> 00:28:46.082
Gordon: <i>So where were
you this afternoon?</i>

00:28:46.116 --> 00:28:48.317
What's the difference?
It's Saturday.

00:28:48.352 --> 00:28:51.220
- My grades are fine, too.
- Rock on, Max.

00:28:51.254 --> 00:28:54.757
Deva, this isn't a joke. Your
mother and I are worried about you.

00:28:54.791 --> 00:28:56.525
Well, there's nothing
to be worried about.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.362
- Okay?
- That's not what it looks like.

00:28:59.396 --> 00:29:01.430
What...

00:29:01.465 --> 00:29:03.065
Well, that went well.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.135
- <i>( door slams )</i>
- I just... I can't do this right now.

00:29:08.171 --> 00:29:11.340
- <i>( loud music playing )</i>
- Hey, we are not finished.

00:29:12.242 --> 00:29:13.642
Women, right?

00:29:13.677 --> 00:29:16.111
( chuckles ) You little...

00:29:16.146 --> 00:29:17.980
( growls )

00:29:18.014 --> 00:29:19.849

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:21.684
- If you turn into a
teenager, I will kill you.

00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:53.952
- Mr. Bowman.
- Deputy Brock.

00:29:53.987 --> 00:29:55.654
What can we do for you?

00:29:55.688 --> 00:29:58.290
- You are the new sheriff?
- That's right.

00:29:58.324 --> 00:30:01.093
Something is happening
at the Yoder farm tonight.

00:30:01.128 --> 00:30:02.761
Some kind of a barn party.

00:30:02.796 --> 00:30:04.897
- A rave?
- Yes.

00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:07.667
My son used that word.
He saw them setting it up.

00:30:07.701 --> 00:30:10.269
A rave in this town?

00:30:10.303 --> 00:30:12.505
Emmett.

00:30:12.539 --> 00:30:15.375
Yeah, thank you for coming in.

00:30:20.014 --> 00:30:24.618
Sheriff, you'll keep my
family's name out of this?

00:30:24.653 --> 00:30:26.654
Yeah, you were never here.

00:30:26.688 --> 00:30:28.956
Thank you.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.259
My daughter Rebecca.

00:30:40.802 --> 00:30:43.538
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Sheriff Hood.

00:30:43.572 --> 00:30:45.207
Very nice to meet you.

00:30:46.776 --> 00:30:48.443
You, too.

00:30:48.477 --> 00:30:51.546
Elijah: <i>Rebecca, get in.</i>

00:31:05.494 --> 00:31:07.629

00:31:09.032 --> 00:31:11.400
What's going on?

00:31:11.434 --> 00:31:12.901
<i>Are we going to war?</i>

00:31:12.935 --> 00:31:15.204
These raves are highly
organized enterprises.

00:31:15.238 --> 00:31:18.440
It's designed for the sole
purpose of selling drugs.

00:31:18.474 --> 00:31:21.710
And where there are drugs,
there will be guns.

00:31:21.744 --> 00:31:23.812
Usually by the time
we hear about it,

00:31:23.846 --> 00:31:26.014
the place is trashed
and everyone is long gone.

00:31:26.048 --> 00:31:28.349
Let's go.

00:31:28.384 --> 00:31:30.018
Right?

00:31:30.052 --> 00:31:31.586
<i>( train horn blaring )</i>

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.221
Right.

00:31:35.424 --> 00:31:38.593
Like, oh, my God.
There's so many people.

00:31:38.627 --> 00:31:40.595
We're with Hanson.
Beaty and Deva.

00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:42.797
Girl: <i>Oh, like
that's gonna help?</i>

00:31:42.831 --> 00:31:46.667
- <i>Why don't you wait like everybody else?</i>
- VIPs? Nice.

<i>( music blaring )</i>

00:31:56.077 --> 00:31:57.344
Hey, Hanson!

00:31:57.378 --> 00:31:59.078
Yeah, police band all quiet?

00:31:59.113 --> 00:32:01.247
Okay, people, let's get paid.

00:32:40.154 --> 00:32:42.957
- Hey!
- You made it. Hey.

00:32:42.991 --> 00:32:45.359
What's up? Oh, my God.

00:32:45.393 --> 00:32:48.328
- Snacks, anyone?
- Oh, Skulls!

00:32:48.363 --> 00:32:50.998
- What is it?
- It's E.

00:33:05.746 --> 00:33:08.115
( cheering )

00:33:13.889 --> 00:33:15.556
Whoo!

00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:18.092
( labored breathing )

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.867
Hey, baby.

00:33:26.902 --> 00:33:28.736
You okay?

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:30.871
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:33:43.485 --> 00:33:45.085
Deva.

00:33:46.888 --> 00:33:48.622
Deva.

00:33:48.657 --> 00:33:51.492

So what's the plan?

00:34:40.708 --> 00:34:43.709
All right, there's only two
ways in and out of here...

00:34:43.744 --> 00:34:47.146
that front entrance and then there's
a utility door around back.

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.148
Should be pretty easy
for us to cover.

00:34:49.182 --> 00:34:52.184
Yeah, but God only knows how
many kids are actually in there.

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:53.752
Start a panic,

00:34:53.787 --> 00:34:56.455
this thing could go
from bad to worse fast.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:57.957
What are you doing?

00:34:57.991 --> 00:35:00.025
We need to see inside.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.994
If I can find
the guy in charge,

00:35:02.028 --> 00:35:05.297
we can shut this down
without starting a riot.

00:35:05.331 --> 00:35:08.667
So you're just gonna wander in
there and ask who's in charge?

00:35:08.701 --> 00:35:10.802
- That's your plan?
- Yeah.

00:35:10.837 --> 00:35:13.271
Oh, great.

00:35:13.306 --> 00:35:15.907
Aren't you kind of old
to pass for a teenager?

00:35:15.941 --> 00:35:17.375
I'm young at heart.

00:35:17.409 --> 00:35:19.043
Can't be out of uniform, Hood.

00:35:19.078 --> 00:35:20.678
You are legally required
to identify yourself.

00:35:20.713 --> 00:35:22.414
Is he always this much fun?

00:35:35.295 --> 00:35:36.995
Yeah, I'm here for the rave.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.931
- There's no rave here.
- Come on, guys, what's it gonna take?

00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:47.839
Shit. Are you kidding me?

00:35:49.541 --> 00:35:52.343
He can't... he can't
just do that, right?

00:35:58.017 --> 00:36:01.454
- Siobhan: He's waving.
- Brock: Yeah.

00:36:01.488 --> 00:36:03.422

gonna be here long
after you're gone,

the smartest career move
you could make

would be to get

in Philadelphia and DC.

00:44:26.035 --> 00:44:28.003

developing that network.

00:44:29.472 --> 00:44:31.439

a fucking idiot,

in this county.

I sleep, Mr. Hanson.

You stole my Skulls,

00:44:42.251 --> 00:44:44.418
you cooked up a tainted
batch that killed a boy.

But not just any boy.

00:44:46.054 --> 00:44:49.624
The boy of a state senator.
Do you understand?

You've unleashed
a shitstorm on me.

00:44:51.493 --> 00:44:53.527

00:46:41.306 --> 00:46:44.174
A kid from my neighborhood

00:46:44.242 --> 00:46:46.176
tried to run across
the railroad tracks.

00:46:47.611 --> 00:46:52.448
He tripped on
some gravel and...

00:46:52.516 --> 00:46:55.384
you know.

00:46:59.923 --> 00:47:02.591
Thing is,

00:47:02.625 --> 00:47:05.460
you can't make sense out of it.

00:47:05.495 --> 00:47:07.596
All right?

00:47:09.099 --> 00:47:11.600
It doesn't make sense.

00:47:14.104 --> 00:47:16.271
You hear me?

00:47:18.574 --> 00:47:20.609
You just...

00:47:23.278 --> 00:47:25.680
I don't know.

00:47:25.714 --> 00:47:28.816
You accept it at some point.

00:47:34.056 --> 00:47:36.357
( sniffles )

00:47:38.694 --> 00:47:41.529
Was he a friend of yours?

00:47:41.563 --> 00:47:43.664
The kid on the tracks?

00:47:46.601 --> 00:47:48.536
No.

00:47:50.939 --> 00:47:53.908
No, he was just some asshole
from the neighborhood.

00:47:55.678 --> 00:47:59.180
And I was another asshole who dared
him to beat the 5:15 Amtrak.

00:48:03.418 --> 00:48:06.220
Now you listen to me. Hey.

00:48:10.526 --> 00:48:12.927
You're gonna be okay.

00:48:27.809 --> 00:48:29.977
( sighs )

00:48:30.011 --> 00:48:32.146
( sniffling )
