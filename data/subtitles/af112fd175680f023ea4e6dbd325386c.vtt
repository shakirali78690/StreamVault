WEBVTT

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.404
Fuck me.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.564
Hi, Job.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.690
- You're out.
- I'm out.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.606
Listen, I know why you're here,
but I cannot help you.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.524
Hey!

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.050
Just give me the address, Job.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.371
Why are you even assuming I know how to...

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.568
No, no, no! Motherfucker!

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.571
Quit breaking my shit.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.650
Baby, you know how this works.
The trail is cold.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.130
Okay, okay, okay!
Just stop the carnage.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.564
You've got the whole
world in front of you...

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.725
...and you're going to the one place
you absolutely should not go.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.165
What, are you crazy?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.324
Hey!

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.488
Morning, everyone.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.805
I've reviewed the defense's
motion to dismiss.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.009
And based on the evidence,
or the lack thereof...

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.682
...it's my opinion that the prosecution
cannot sustain the burden for a trial...

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.723
- Are you kidding?
- ...so I'm finding for the defense.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.211
Case dismissed.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.925
You can't take this to trial, Gordon.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.007
You should be thanking me
for saving you the embarrassment.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.084
- Gordon.
- Jackson.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.011
That a judge in your pocket
or you just happy to see me?

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.765
Mr. Mayor.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.726
- Jesus Christ, Gordon.
- Oh, pace yourself, Dan.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.682
Our day will come.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.729
Guys like Kai Proctor
don't go down easy.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.488
Carrie.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.045
Hey.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.725
You'll get him next time, counselor.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.770
Yeah, I am ready for this day to be over.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.611
Again?

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.410
Yeah.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.484
It's nothing to freak out about.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.927
We're not freaking out.
We're just talking to you.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.731
My point is we don't solve
our problems with violence.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.769
I just completed another level.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.843
Yeah, it happens every day, Dad.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.048
I just can't believe that you
kicked your teacher.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.521
- Substitute teacher.
- Oh, well, it's okay, then.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.682
He's a perv, Mom.
He tried to see down my shirt.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.968
With a shirt like that,
it doesn't take much trying.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.645
- So it's my fault?
- Gordon.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.565
So if I get molested by a teacher,
you'll just blame it on my shirt?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.131
- Deva, come on.
- Okay, all right.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.971
Max, honey, you have your inhaler?

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.601
Dr. Welling referred Max
to another pulmonologist.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.205
We have an appointment next week.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.091
Okay. Great.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.847
- Is your shoulder bad today?
- Ah, it's just the usual.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.809
It'll be all right.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.485
I think I might grab a shower.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.284
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.088
That's Beaty. Later.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.444
You're late, bitch.
- Whatever, skank.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.329
So, are you in shit with your parents?

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.364
- Yeah, when am I not?
- Ha, ha.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.090
Howdy.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.802
I'm gonna go with shitty day...

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.204
- ...and whiskey neat.
- Whiskey's fine.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.168
And one for yourself.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.643
Are you coming or going?

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.361
I'm still working that out.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.202
That's me, Sugar Bates...

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.368
...in the cruiservveight years.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.682
When'd you drop him?

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.649
Fifth?

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.529
Eighth.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.206
He was a southpaw. They take longer.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.048
See, it was a title fight.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.362
I held the belt for 18 months.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.285
I used to hang it right up there.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.601
You know?

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.047
A good conversation piece.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.328
But with this tough economy,
I had to pawn it...

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.246
...a little while back
to pay for the leaking taps.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.608
That's a shame.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.603
Where are you from?

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.929
Different places.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.289
Where'd you sit?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.570
Roscoe.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.241
I did eight years at Allenwood.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.044
You look fresh.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.484
Freedom.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.444
Freedom.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.560
Always this quiet around here?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.530
Well, let's stimulate
the local economy.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.444
Next round's on me.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.090
Ha, ha. All right.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.403
All you tourists buying me drinks today.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.206
I'm not a tourist.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.569
My name is Lucas Hood.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.560
And come Monday, I'm being sworn in
as the new sheriff.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.649
Congratulations.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.202
Or should we say good luck?

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.203
I'll take both, thanks.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.488
I spent nine years as sheriff
up in Church, Oregon.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.722
You ever heard of it?

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.770
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
It's the armpit of the West.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.048
This is my first day east.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.487
I just drove clear across the country.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.210
There's less to see than you'd think.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.331
I thought the sheriff had to be elected.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.882
Usually, but under certain
circumstances, the mayor can bring in a ringer.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.924
He and Sheriff Morgan
are the ones who hired me so...

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.367
I was looking forward to meeting
them when I got here.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.320
Yeah, well, that'd be quite a trick
since he died last Tuesday.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.845
Liver cancer.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.445
I think he thought he had more time.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.204
Aw, shit.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.044
Your boss know you're here?

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.966
Don't worry about him. You know the drill.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.207
Look at this guy.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.924
Excuse me.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.048
Are we disturbing you?

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.885
No, not at all.
This is just a very good steak.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.050
And I know that once I stand up
to deal with you fellas...

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.885
...well, maybe you'll come quietly
or maybe I'll have to kill you...

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.362
...but either way, this steak is gonna get cold.
And you can always reheat a steak...

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.848
...but it's never quite the same. Hmm?

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.771
You got some balls on you, motherfucker.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.167
Sheriff's Department.
I'll take that gun now.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.163
No, you drop your fucking gun.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.961
That's the new STI, isn't it?

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.361
- That's a hard gun to get.
- Who the fuck is this guy?

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.171
- You sit your ass down.
- All right, hear me out, sheriff.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.448
- They got you outgunned.
- Damn straight we do.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.326
While on the other hand, if he shoots,
one of you boys is dead...

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.444
...or shitting in a bag the
rest of his life. For what?

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.047
The 200 bucks Sugar has in the register
at 4 p.m. on a Tuesday? Come on.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.363
So, Sheriff, why don't you
let them take the cash?

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.851
Just let them take it.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.843
I'll buy enough drinks to make him whole.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.844
Everyone goes home happy.
What do you say?

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.880
Come on.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.721
Oh, God!

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.001
Am I dead?

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.401
Yeah.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.281
It's my first day in town.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.601
Shit!

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.325
Sorry.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.724
I hope my mother was right about God.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.442
Jesus ripshit Christ.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.286
This is what you call in the Bible...

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.967
...a "clusterfuck of epic proportions."

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:11.003
Two cons, three corpses,
one of them a cop.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.283
I don't like that math.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.883
You'd better get out of here.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.200
Well, they would have killed me
same as him.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.364
The least I can do is
give you a head start.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.810
What about you?

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.088
I got a few tricks.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.329
Go on, now. Get out of here.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.850
Hi, Ana.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.928
How did you find me?

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.529
It was Job.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.244
It's a nice house.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.322
Yeah, it seems, um...

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.801
...uh, solid.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.323
So, what do you have, two kids?

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.127
- Yes.
- Yeah?

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.491
How old?

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.688
My son is 8.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.523
My daughter is 13.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.085
Hmm.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.685
She looks older.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.522
I can smell your perfume from here.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.450
Please, you're gonna have to leave.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.490
Please. Please.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.085
Ana.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.402
I'm not Ana anymore.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.050
My name is Carrie.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.007
Where were you?

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.288
- I tried to visit.
- No. 15 years.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.011
- I drove up to those gates.
- You were here playing fucking house?

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.447
- You have no idea how many times.
- Don't you tell me that.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.928
- Where the fuck were you?
- I don't have to justify myself to you.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.287
I have responsibilities.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.289
I have children.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.605
Okay?

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.922
I have a husband who loves me.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.886
Hey.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.843
- It's me.
- Don't. I can't.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.331
You could have led Rabbit straight to me.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.520
What the fuck were you thinking?

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.010
Okay.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.166
You moved on. I get it.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.523
So give me my cut
and you'll never see me again.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.005
I don't have the diamonds.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.289
What? What?

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.364
After we screwed Rabbit like that
and you had gotten caught...

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.205
No, no, I did not get caught.
There were two of us there that night!

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.169
- Shh, shh! I know.
- I led them away from you!

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.211
Listen, I tried to fence them.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.161
The guys I found,
these real bottom-feeders, Serbians...

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.045
...they saw me coming.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.002
You're telling me you got rolled?

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.321
Does it look like I'm
sitting on $10 million?

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.249
Mm.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.363
I don't get the girl.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.969
I don't get the money.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.122
I spent 15 years picturing this day...

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.727
...and I gotta tell you,
this is not how I saw it playing out.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.043
I'm so sorry. I am so fucking sorry.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.804
Hey, babe, you out here?
- Shit.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.487
Yeah. Hey, honey. Raccoon.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.367
Christ.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.170
You trying to kill me?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.650
Have you picked a spot yet?

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.567
You one of them complicated types.
Is that it?

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.164
No, some people just don't know
simple when they see it.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.163
Don't seem right...

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.289
...burying the sheriff with that pond scum.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.761
What, do you wanna dig him his own hole?

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.366
Yeah, that'd be the Christian thing to do.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.045
That you?

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.363
- Hello?
- Sheriff Hood...

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.251
...it's Mayor Dan Kendall.
Am I catching you at a bad time?

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.650
Sheriff?

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.531
Are you there?

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.726
- Yeah, this is Hood.
- How's the drive going?

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.969
A lot less to see than you'd think.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.801
Well, I just wanted to confirm tomorrow.
You'll be in town by then?

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.284
- Should be, yeah.
- Great.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.966
So that's 1:00 at Miles' Diner.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.327
I look forward to finally
meeting you in person.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.086
Great. I'll see you then.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.926
Now tell me you got some kind
of master plan here.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.927
Well, I usually just get by with my charm.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.922
- Hishi Salon.
- I need a favor.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.521
And I need $5000 for all
the shit you broke.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.570
- I'll make it 10.
- Fuck you!

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.684
- Speak.
- I need to become someone else.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.450
Honey child, don't we all?

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.329
Someone specific.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.367
- Name?
- Lucas Hood...

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.965
...of Church, Oregon.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.122
Shouldn't be a problem.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.363
Unless he's a motherfucking cop.
Are you kidding me?

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.005
I need it quick, Job.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.969
Baby, you just sat for 15 years...

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.125
...because you were the most notorious thief
in the country. Now you want to play cop?

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.560
Can you do it?

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.927
<i>I mean, I have to hack
law-enforcement databases</i>

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.764
...swap out fingerprints and photo IDs...

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.127
...find any news article that
might have run a picture...

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.248
- So you can't do it?
- Suck my tit, bitch!

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.323
Of course I can do it.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.768
Take a couple days.
As for the credentials...

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.008
...I can get you the papers,
but the badge itself...

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.730
I got the badge.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.207
I don't even wanna know.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.971
You know, some cons,
the minute they get out...

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.771
...they're just trying
like hell to get back in.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.160
I'm not going back.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.764
Yeah, well, you got a revolutionary way
of staying out of trouble.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.526
Here.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.967
The pickup belonged to the sheriff.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.291
Thanks.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.805
Hey.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.163
You got a place to stay?

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.364
No one's ever stolen from Rabbit.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.126
Okay.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.971
Hey, go in back and stay out of sight.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.600
- What for?
- Go now.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.483
Morning, Sugar.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.130
Kai.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.964
How are the headaches?

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.047
Did those Mexican painkillers
I got you help?

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.851
They did. Thanks.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.083
What brings you around?

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:51.401
Randall and Munson.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.881
Munson, the bald one?

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.328
One of the boys thought they might have been
headed out this way yesterday afternoon.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.289
Well, they didn't come here.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.363
If they did, I'd have taken notice.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.566
If any of my employees
ever stepped out of line...

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.008
...hassled you in any way,
I'd expect you to call me.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.846
What I mean is I wouldn't want you
to take matters into your own hands.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.685
Ha, ha. Look at me.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:20.367
Nobody runs from a fight
faster than an old fighter.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.368
What happened to your title fight?

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.842
Oh, I knocked it off the hook the
other night, busted up the frame.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.604
I'm having it redone.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.483
Ah. Thanks for the drink.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.442
You let me know if you need
any more of those painkillers.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.444
That's some car.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.044
Look, if you're thinking
of stealing from Kai Proctor...

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.771
...you may as well take a bullet
and put it in your head now.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.485
Kai Proctor.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.287
There is a name.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.647
What the man doesn't own, he runs.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.371
What he doesn't run,
he burns to the ground.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.371
He seemed to like you well enough.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.971
We go back a ways.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.042
- Uh-huh.
- Listen.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.364
You don't seem like the kind of guy
who takes advice...

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.281
...but I'm gonna try anyway.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.606
There's $400. Take it and go.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.681
- I can't.
- Look around.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.922
You're free, man.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.442
Pay you back in a few days.

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.848
Good to meet you. Lucas Hood.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.731
Lucas Hood. How are...? How...?

00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:00.688
It's a legitimate concern
and I promise I'll talk to the school.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.765
Excuse me.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.001
- Say hi to Amy.
- Thank you.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.443
- Sheriff Hood?
- That's right.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.923
It's great to meet you.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.407
Yeah, you too.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.570
I know, I look young,
but that's just because I am.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.531
Have a seat.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.802
Job, two suits, badly tailored.
They're looking for you.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.524
Cops?

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.609
Let's hope so.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.611
I want all the backup
drives in the car now.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.007
Keep the engine running.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.283
Gentlemen, we don't
actually open till 10...

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.286
...but if you'll follow me back upstairs, I'm
sure we can find somewhere to fit you in.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.570
Down here might be better for
the private nature of our inquiry.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.166
Inquiry? Hmm.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.569
May I see some ID?

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.965
This ain't a badge.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.164
No. it's not.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.169
Fucking slope cunt!

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.967
We work for Mr. Rabbit.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.691
Sweet fuck.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.083
The guy you're looking for came
in a couple of days ago.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.720
- And what did he want?
- Just the usual, man.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.605
Credit cards, ID's.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.690
- Where is he now?
- I'll tell Mr. Rabbit whatever he wants...

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.842
...but I've no idea.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.966
Okay, okay, okay!

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.168
I'll get the file! It's in the safe.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.724
That would be helpful.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.525
Love me

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.887
Love, love, love Love me

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:07.806
I'll be anything you want me
To be, baby

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.846
Drive.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.207
So I pissed off some people
when I hired you.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.011
But every sheriff that we've had,
including Morgan...

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.289
...ended up on Proctor's payroll,
so I needed an outsider.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.124
So you brought me in here to take down
this one guy? This Proctor?

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.607
He's not just one guy, all right?

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.765
There's not a criminal enterprise around here
that doesn't start or end in his pockets.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.883
Now, I know you don't work till Monday...

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.447
...but I wanna show you the Cadi.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.681
The Cadi?

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.651
The old Sheriff's Department
burned down three years ago.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.126
City Hall was pretty strapped.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.806
Froemer's Cadillac had just gone under,
so we got creative.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.928
Girl, you're gonna leave that man...

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.242
- ...and you're gonna leave that man tonight.
- Mm-mm.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.606
Alma.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.161
Um, I'll call you later.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.765
Meet Lucas Hood.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.207
- Good to meet you, Alma.
- Sheriff Hood.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.084
Great to meet you.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.410
Mm-hm.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.167
- Afternoon, mayor.
- This is Lucas Hood.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.686
This is Emmett Yawners.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.127
He's one of the top 10 rushers
of all time at Penn State.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.248
- Good to meet you.
- Welcome to the B.S.D.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.643
This is Brock Lotus, our
longest-serving member of the department.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.690
- That right?
- How are you doing, sheriff?

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.042
You fucking fascist!

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.531
I didn't even do anything.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.041
Oh, yeah, you're a model citizen.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.404
You try and fight me again,
I remove your fucking testicles.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.040
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.806
This is Lucas Hood. It's your new boss.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.807
Well, shit, Danny, you could have
said so sooner. I'm Siobhan Kelly.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.962
- My name's Peter.
- Shut the fuck up!

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.805
I was thinking maybe you could show
the sheriff the town of Banshee.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.089
Oh, I'd love to, but, uh, I have
to write up Charlie Sheen here.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.042
Actually, uh, I'd love a tour...

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.521
...from the longest-sewing member
of the department.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.561
All right, so why don't we start
on the outskirts of town?

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.166
There's an Indian casino.
Work our way back.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:16.524
Did I catch you on a bad day
or you always this cheerful?

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.802
AW, shit.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.725
What's going on?

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.722
Moody boys build furniture and the Amish
mills have been driving down their prices.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.247
We've, uh... We've had incidents.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.806
They won't hit back.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.849
Oh, you've seen Witness.
Yeah, that's great.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.525
Why don't you let me handle this, huh?

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.286
- Yeah, sure.
- Hood, Hood!

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.485
Whoops!

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.088
We don't work, you don't work.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.163
- The fuck up, punk.
- Hey!

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.400
Why don't we all just take a moment...

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.364
...talk about this?

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.164
Who the fuck are you?

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.529
Lucas Hood. I'm the new sheriff.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.767
Hey, Lotus, I thought you were supposed
to take over when Morgan kicked.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.282
Yeah, well, you and me both.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.204
Hey! Cole. That's enough.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.403
I'm sure your wife's got better things to
do than bail your ass out of jail today.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.167
- I'm not through messing with them.
- Yeah, you are.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.688
If you're the sheriff,
why aren't you in uniform?

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.962
I don't start till Monday.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.287
So there's nothing stopping us
from fucking your shit up today, then, huh?

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.962
Yeah. I hoped you'd make that connection.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.408
- All right, boys.
- Easy, deputy. I got this.

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.849
So, come on, Cole...

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.410
...fuck my shit up.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.486
All right, just to be clear,
we'll be pounding a civilian...

00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.806
Come on, motherfucker. Get up!

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.604
Get his ass, Cole. Get his ass!

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.211
That's enough, Cole.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.691
Mr. Proctor.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.082
Your four-on-one advantage
wasn't enough?

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.170
You needed this?

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.810
Come on, guys.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.604
Hold on.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.764
These men are on a schedule.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.208
Why don't you boys help them
load their wagons?

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.848
Yes, sir. Come on.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.288
You are?

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.047
- Lucas Hood.
- The new sheriff.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.842
Fucking Dutchie. This isn't over.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.644
Kai Proctor.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.451
Sorry if I stepped on your toes there.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.286
- Mr. Proctor, what exactly do you do?
- I'm in meats.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.769
Why don't you stop by
the slaughterhouse?

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.400
I'll set you up with some nice steaks.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.967
Father...

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.121
...it's good to see you.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.731
Hey, Lotus, I'm gonna walk.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.482
You're welcome, by the way.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.041
I have to go.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.089
Come on, stay with me.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.522
- See you later.
- What?

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.730
But I love you.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.610
- Whoa! You okay?
- Yeah, my bad.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.047
Okay. It's all right.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.491
Thirteen years old, my ass.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.371
Hey. Sorry, you dropped this.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.801
- Thanks.
- Shouldn't you be in school?

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.889
Yeah, I should.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.362
Can't your boyfriend take you back?

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.404
Who says he's my boyfriend?

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.562
Well, I hope he's not your brother.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.369
P&Ls.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.847
Our numbers are down
at both strip clubs?

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.811
With the economy what it is...

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.405
Men will pay for tits
until they're broke or dead.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.721
Fix that, Burton.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.202
You said you wanted to see me?

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.808
It's a relatively humane procedure.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.804
We stun the beasts
with a pneumatic captive bolt gun...

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.610
One of these.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.361
One bolt to the brain does the trick.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.401
Then we cut them
and they quietly bleed out.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.611
- Listen, um...
- The Old Order Pennsylvania Dutch...

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.564
...don't like being called "Dutchies."

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.966
It's derisive.

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.966
I believe I heard you call my father
a "fucking Dutchie."

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.882
I was just running my mouth.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.520
I didn't know he was your father.

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.887
Now you take your teeth
and put them back...

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.401
...in your fat, bigoted mouth
and get the fuck out of here.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.128
Back in your mouth, I said.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.807
Why don't you see Mr. Moody out?

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.087
You.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.202
- They get your size wrong?
- No, I'm good.

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.328
Bring the pants to the Martinizing over by the diner.
They'll take them in for you.

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.648
All right, thanks. I'll do that.

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:33.842
Ha, ha. You got any family
coming to the swearing in?

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.004
No, I don't have any family...

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.290
...coming or not.

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.242
Well, we'll all be there...

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.443
...and at Proctor's reception after.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:46.806
Reception?

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:51.086
Say what you will about Proctor,
but the man knows how to throw a party.

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.731
There. Now that's what
a sheriff looks like.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.326
- I do solemnly swear...
- I do solemnly swear...

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.165
...that I will support,
protect, and defend...

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:18.045
...that I will support,
protect, and defend...

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:21.449
...the Constitution
and government of the United States...

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.126
...the Constitution and government
of the United States...

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.602
...and of the State of Pennsylvania...

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.206
...that I have no knowledge
of any circumstance...

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.840
...that I have no knowledge
of any circumstance...

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.446
<i>...past or present
...past or present.</i>

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.444
...that would disqualify me
from the assignment of this office...

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.410
...that would disqualify me from
the assignment of this office...

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.649
- ...that I have neither given...
- ...that I have neither given...

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.441
...nor will give any person
any gratuity, gift, fee, or reward...

00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.331
...in consideration of
support for this office...

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.605
...nor will give any person
any gratuity, gift, fee, or reward...

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.048
...in consideration of support
for this office...

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.164
...that I am duly
qualified to hold office...

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.482
...that I am duly qualified
to hold office...

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:08.440
- ...under the Constitution of the state...
- ...under the Constitution of the state...

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.126
...and that I will well
and faithfully perform...

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.282
...and that I will well
and faithfully perform...

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.522
...the duties of Banshee County Sheriff...

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.364
...the duties of Banshee County Sheriff...

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.249
...the office of which I now enter...

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.050
...the office of which I now enter...

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:24.124
...so help me God.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.804
Understated as usual.

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.088
You just charged the man
with racketeering.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.409
Now you're at his party.
Only in Banshee.

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.845
Sheriff Hood.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.171
Mr. Proctor.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.286
This is some shindig.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.920
You'll find that Banshee
is not the backwater town...

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.367
...it sometimes pretends to be.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.410
You enjoy yourself.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.483
I'll check in on you soon.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:18.806
Sure.

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.329
Sheriff Hood. Gordon Hopewell.

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.848
- We met at the swearing in.
- The DA, right?

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.288
Honey, come over
and meet our new sheriff.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.170
Hi.

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.681
Lucas Hood. Great to meet you.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.084
Carrie?

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.129
I'm sorry. I'm not myself tonight.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.442
No? Who are you, then?

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.328
Good to meet you, Mrs. Hopewell.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.887
I'm telling you,
there's something wrong with that guy.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.283
He went through the Moody boys
like they were cardboard.

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:05.161
So you're upset that our sheriff
knows how to fight?

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.970
It wasn't just fighting, Emmett.

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.965
It was fucking combat.

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.564
Sheriff Hood...

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.407
...I'd like you to meet
Chief Benjamin Longshadow...

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.244
...of the local Kinaho Tribe...

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:19.244
...a good friend and a great man
revered in Banshee.

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:22.802
- Good to meet you, chief.
- Likewise, Sheriff Hood.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.247
My son Alex.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.765
- Hi.
- Hey, Alex.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.720
When you get settled, my tribal council...

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:33.247
...wants to honor you with a dinner.

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.448
On the reservation, of course.

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:38.285
Yeah, um, that sounds great.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.528
Uh, you'll... You'll excuse me?

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.889
A sheriff?

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.963
Are you kidding me?

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.521
They have a great health plan.

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.200
You're not gonna need it in prison.

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.201
You used to have more faith in me.

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:24.046
- Why are you doing this?
- You know why.

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.289
Come here for a sec.

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.291
- I don't believe this.
- It's an old Sargent safe.

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:46.125
I can't get in there,
but you could do it in your sleep.

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.521
- Jesus.
- Come on, it's the least you can do.

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.210
No.

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.727
What you're doing is crazy.
If you don't end it, I will.

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:57.886
Yeah? You're in no position
to blow any whistles, Mrs. Hopewell.

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.080
You're insane.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.330
Honey...

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.924
...I'm feeling pretty tired.

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:25.129
You're preaching to the choir.
I think we've stayed long enough.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.242
Kai, thanks for having us.

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:33.120
Sure.

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.203
Glad you stopped by.

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.249
This isn't awkward at all.

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.047
Oh, my God!
- Proctor!

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.409
- Get out of here.
- Just stay there.

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:52.049
Get down, get down.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.521
Please.
- Dutchie motherfucker!

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:37.082
Taxi!

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.529
Knight to rook four.

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.281
Yours.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:13.288
Pishak to queen three.

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.925
Yours.

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:23.405
So, no documents...

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:26.521
...no software, no hardware.

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:32.363
Everything in this hairdresser's, burned?

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:34.010
Yes.

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:39.170
Queen to knight two. Checkmate.

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.450
You will find them both...

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.090
...quickly.
