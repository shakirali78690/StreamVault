00:00:00.116 --> 00:00:01.453
<i>Previously on Banshee...</i>

00:00:01.478 --> 00:00:03.349
We could do a bank,
do diamonds.

00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:05.843
Do you have any idea what it
takes to crack a truck like that?

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:07.031
No, none at all.
That's why you're here.

00:00:07.056 --> 00:00:10.237
You're still the same reckless
thrill junkie you were 15 years ago.

00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:11.167
You're not so different.

00:00:11.192 --> 00:00:12.961
I'm not out there risking
everything for the thrill.

00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:14.594
I wasn't the one
driving the getaway car.

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.065
Here to savor the moment.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.331
Enjoy it, Mr. Mayor.

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:18.644
Because a moment is
all you'll get.

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.042
You have no right to bring her
in here.

00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:21.314
Mom, I'm not in trouble.

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.166
If you want to see or speak to
my daughter, you ask me first.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.017
- I want him.
- I can't do that..

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:28.420
If you could, you would be free.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.200
They don't like to see
a black man with a badge.

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:32.354
Hey, it's okay, guys.
His wife is white.

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:33.164
I'm ready...

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:34.119
to bring him to you.

00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:36.144
She will bring him.

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:20.485
I'm ready
to bring him to you.

00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:32.811
Finally.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.655
Finally.

00:03:10.412 --> 00:03:12.648
Mr. Proctor.

00:03:16.656 --> 00:03:18.157
Hello, Kai.

00:03:23.592 --> 00:03:25.882
Hold the work.
Clear the room.

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:31.580
I'll call
you guys later.

00:03:35.912 --> 00:03:38.055
Would you excuse us, Burton?

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.999
Last time you spoke to me,

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:52.003
we were pulling yams
in your father's field.

00:03:52.038 --> 00:03:54.690
You barely even had
that beard yet.

00:03:55.063 --> 00:03:58.015
I've come to talk to you
about Rebecca.

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.529
How is your daughter?

00:04:01.563 --> 00:04:03.392
There's no need to pretend.

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:05.877
I know that she
talks to you.

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:09.624
She defies every other rule,
so why not that one?

00:04:16.515 --> 00:04:19.528
I wouldn't have come
if I didn't think--

00:04:22.288 --> 00:04:25.006
she is my daughter
and I love her.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.687
But she is getting lost.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.302
What happened to you

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:33.526
has saddened me.

00:04:35.018 --> 00:04:37.635
I don't want
to lose her.

00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:41.382
I understand.

00:04:41.416 --> 00:04:44.107
She trusts you.

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:46.059
And because of that,

00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:49.078
maybe she would
listen to you.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.063
Maybe she would.

00:04:52.098 --> 00:04:54.220
Good.

00:04:55.317 --> 00:04:57.206
I still pray for you, Kai.

00:05:07.277 --> 00:05:10.729
And they were carrots,
not yams.

00:05:32.027 --> 00:05:33.683
Don't you got
to get going?

00:05:33.717 --> 00:05:35.840
Mmm.

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:39.892
I don't think a few kids
in Saturday detention

00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:42.939
will be too crushed
if I'm a little late.

00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:57.240
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

00:05:57.258 --> 00:06:00.454
Nothing.
I'm just distracted.

00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:06.337
You've been distracted
for the last year, Dan.

00:06:06.371 --> 00:06:09.423
Yeah, well, there's a lot
going on at work.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.670
Well, what about
what's going on here?

00:06:13.563 --> 00:06:16.848
Or not going on,
actually.

00:06:16.883 --> 00:06:20.329
Well, I'm just
a little bit stressed out.

00:06:22.287 --> 00:06:24.905
Okay.
I've got to go to work.

00:06:32.874 --> 00:06:34.296
<i>Four casino guards,</i>

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.687
<i>two drivers,</i>
<i>and another in the back.</i>

00:06:36.721 --> 00:06:39.767
<i>I've studied the photos</i>
<i>and the schematics.</i>

00:06:39.802 --> 00:06:43.287
And it's like I said, we ain't getting
into that truck once it's closed.

00:06:43.322 --> 00:06:45.740
Well, we can't take 'em
in that loading bay,

00:06:45.774 --> 00:06:47.035
if that's what
you're thinking.

00:06:47.103 --> 00:06:48.592
We'd be dead
inside a minute.

00:06:48.627 --> 00:06:50.255
You got a better idea?

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:52.607
Yeah, anything but that.

00:06:53.264 --> 00:06:56.149
Can we please set you up with a
computer and Quicken or some shit?

00:06:56.184 --> 00:06:57.907
Looking at you is like
watching the History Channel.

00:06:57.941 --> 00:06:59.536
You of all people
should know

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.955
that computers
are not secure.

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:03.912
Yeah, there's a million
hackers in China

00:07:03.947 --> 00:07:05.636
just dying to get their
hands on your financials.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.098
These aren't rent-a-cops.

00:07:07.132 --> 00:07:08.755
<i>This is Longshadow's</i>
<i>hand-vetted security team.</i>

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:10.546
- They'll die for him.
- Well, what then?

00:07:12.915 --> 00:07:14.865
We need a friend
in the truck.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.257
Lord, I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:18.814
Hood.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.815
I'll be there.

00:07:31.477 --> 00:07:33.661
Oh, for fuck's sake,
I know it was her.

00:07:33.696 --> 00:07:35.543
I can hear your heart
beating from here.

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:38.839
She says she has
a fence for the stones.

00:07:38.873 --> 00:07:41.424
Just like that?
Fucking spectacular.

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:43.415
After 15 years she just
suddenly found someone.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.011
That's what she said, Job.

00:07:45.046 --> 00:07:47.597
There is no fence, man.
You know it.

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:52.736
Maybe not.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.826
Then why are you going?

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.050
- Because it's her.
- She is not her anymore.

00:07:57.085 --> 00:07:59.362
And whoever she is,
she's gonna get you killed.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.426
We'll see.

00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:04.351
There is pussy-whipped

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:06.308
and then there is that
hopeless motherfucker.

00:08:06.342 --> 00:08:08.560
Oh, for fuck's sake.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.720
Hey.

00:08:20.754 --> 00:08:22.549
Just like old times.

00:08:22.584 --> 00:08:25.107
Don't get too attached. This
is just unfinished business.

00:08:25.142 --> 00:08:27.339
We got no shortage
of that, right?

00:08:44.002 --> 00:08:45.354
Where'd you find
these guys?

00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:47.817
I started putting out feelers
when you came to town.

00:08:47.885 --> 00:08:50.165
A guy in Jersey
came through.

00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:52.642
You trust him?

00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:54.508
If I trusted him, you
wouldn't be coming along.

00:08:56.067 --> 00:08:58.233
God, you were always
better at this than me.

00:09:04.188 --> 00:09:05.627
Fuck!

00:09:05.661 --> 00:09:08.672
I'm sorry.

00:09:08.707 --> 00:09:11.175
- Ana, what are you doing?
- What I have to do.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.010
Oh, fuck.

00:09:14.545 --> 00:09:16.813
I'm sorry.

00:09:16.847 --> 00:09:19.618
Fuck.

00:09:31.296 --> 00:09:34.463
Well, honey, is there
a particular brand you want?

00:09:34.498 --> 00:09:37.466
Well, how about whichever
one gives us a yes, huh?

00:09:39.402 --> 00:09:41.536
All right, baby. Bye.

00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:50.242
Fuck my shit.

00:09:50.277 --> 00:09:53.478
- Don't fucking move!
- Okay. Just calm down.

00:09:53.512 --> 00:09:55.246
Shut the fuck up, cop!

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.014
Keep your hands up,
motherfucker.

00:09:57.048 --> 00:09:58.715
No! Jesus!

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.051
Lance, was that
fucking necessary?

00:10:01.085 --> 00:10:03.886
- He reached for something.
- Please, let me help him.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.822
Get on your fucking knees.

00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:07.889
Get on your
fucking knees!

00:10:07.924 --> 00:10:10.492
Please, no.

00:10:10.526 --> 00:10:12.860
- Fuck me.
- Finish him!

00:10:12.894 --> 00:10:15.629
Finish him!
Let's go!

00:10:15.664 --> 00:10:17.431
Fuck me.

00:10:18.733 --> 00:10:21.035
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not be in want.

00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:23.569
Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

00:10:23.604 --> 00:10:26.005
I shall fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:29.275
Surely goodness, mercy, and love will
follow me all the days of my life

00:10:29.309 --> 00:10:32.277
and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

00:10:42.855 --> 00:10:44.855
Alma, I've got a robbery
in progress.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.859
Shots fired and a civilian
down in the drugstore.

00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:02.539
Stop! Hey!
Step away from that car!

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.051
You should've finished him
in the store, you pussy.

00:11:14.085 --> 00:11:16.052
It was a highly charged
situation.

00:11:16.086 --> 00:11:17.854
And what do you call this?

00:11:17.888 --> 00:11:20.223
Killing a cop
has ramifications.

00:11:20.257 --> 00:11:21.691
Jesus! Fuck!

00:11:33.164 --> 00:11:34.598
Sir, are you all right?

00:11:34.632 --> 00:11:37.133
Okay, look, stay here.
I'll call an ambulance.

00:11:38.969 --> 00:11:41.904
Alma, they're on foot heading towards
the Oak Street parking garage.

00:11:48.411 --> 00:11:50.178
Brock, they just
crossed Oak Street.

00:11:50.212 --> 00:11:51.646
Repeat, they just
crossed Oak.

00:12:09.197 --> 00:12:11.198
That fucker
is still coming.

00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:18.038
Suspects heading towards
Banshee High School gymnasium.

00:12:20.408 --> 00:12:22.643
<i>I said stop!</i>

00:12:22.678 --> 00:12:24.978
- No!
- Come here!

00:12:25.013 --> 00:12:27.280
No! No!

00:12:27.314 --> 00:12:29.816
Let her go now!

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.451
Ow, fuck!

00:12:31.486 --> 00:12:33.053
No!

00:12:33.087 --> 00:12:35.121
Do you have any idea

00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:37.189
what kind of shitshow
you just started?

00:12:37.224 --> 00:12:40.092
One of these days we're gonna find
you a functioning set of balls.

00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:44.095
Oh, great.
Good old BHS.

00:12:44.129 --> 00:12:45.697
Shit, more cops.

00:12:51.837 --> 00:12:53.471
Help him up!

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:55.740
They ain't gonna come in.

00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:58.176
Not when we have us
a hostage.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.245
Mrs. Kendall?

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:04.348
- What the fuck is this?
- It's detention.

00:13:04.382 --> 00:13:06.216
Get down here now!

00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:09.218
Get down from there!
Get up! Move your ass!

00:13:10.354 --> 00:13:11.888
Get over here!

00:13:15.092 --> 00:13:17.025
Now!

00:13:35.345 --> 00:13:36.445
Well, this is new.

00:13:36.479 --> 00:13:38.546
I must have gotten
the dosage wrong.

00:13:38.581 --> 00:13:40.648
You shouldn't have
woken up yet.

00:13:40.683 --> 00:13:42.717
You called him?

00:13:42.751 --> 00:13:45.854
I gave you every chance to leave.
I begged you.

00:13:45.888 --> 00:13:48.290
I didn't want to leave.

00:13:51.393 --> 00:13:53.594
<i>I would tell you to think</i>
<i>about what you're doing,</i>

00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:55.429
but I'm guessing
you already have.

00:13:55.464 --> 00:13:57.063
I'm protecting my family.

00:13:57.097 --> 00:13:59.531
You really think
he won't come after you?

00:13:59.566 --> 00:14:01.333
That's the deal.

00:14:03.736 --> 00:14:07.405
He's gonna torture me
to find you.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.040
And you're not
gonna tell him.

00:14:09.075 --> 00:14:11.709
I'm gonna sing
my fucking lungs out.

00:14:11.744 --> 00:14:14.111
- Good-bye.
- Hey.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:16.980
I'll catch up to you.

00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:50.126
Anything else?

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.190
Yeah, one of them
is named Lance.

00:14:54.221 --> 00:14:57.082
This place was like
church to me.

00:14:58.382 --> 00:15:01.076
<i>We were 1983 state champs.</i>

00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:05.508
<i>I started at point guard.</i>

00:15:05.542 --> 00:15:09.436
You know how many points I
averaged a game, Future Horse?

00:15:10.469 --> 00:15:12.033
20 points.

00:15:12.067 --> 00:15:14.433
Nice.

00:15:14.467 --> 00:15:16.498
<i>Goddamn nice.</i>

00:15:17.364 --> 00:15:19.161
Get down.
Get down.

00:15:21.527 --> 00:15:22.993
Any movement in the front?

00:15:23.026 --> 00:15:24.946
No, all the doors are
chained up except this one.

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:26.790
- Okay, that'll help us.
- Let me see this.

00:15:28.456 --> 00:15:30.052
Fuck.

00:15:30.086 --> 00:15:32.249
All the doors
are padlocked shut.

00:15:32.284 --> 00:15:34.480
There's no fucking
way out of here.

00:15:34.515 --> 00:15:38.009
- Lance, can we focus?
- Can you get off my dick?

00:15:38.043 --> 00:15:39.441
<i>We've got to get the fuck</i>
<i>out of here.</i>

00:15:39.475 --> 00:15:42.304
Oh, I forgot.
You hate this place, don't you?

00:15:42.338 --> 00:15:46.031
- Hey, look what she's got.
- Hey, hey, hey!

00:15:47.765 --> 00:15:50.627
What, are you filming us?
Feisty, huh?

00:15:50.661 --> 00:15:55.186
Leave her alone.
They're just kids.

00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:57.050
But you're not,
are you?

00:15:58.351 --> 00:16:00.747
- You called Hood, right?
- Hood's off today.

00:16:00.782 --> 00:16:02.645
He's out of town
on personal business.

00:16:02.679 --> 00:16:06.072
- Brock, he's the sheriff.
- All right, fine.

00:16:06.107 --> 00:16:08.170
Alma, get me the sheriff.

00:16:08.204 --> 00:16:10.901
<i>I've been trying him.</i>
<i>No answer.</i>

00:16:10.933 --> 00:16:12.431
Why am I not surprised?

00:16:12.465 --> 00:16:14.128
I just say we go in.

00:16:14.162 --> 00:16:15.861
No, we wait.

00:16:15.895 --> 00:16:18.222
They've already killed one person.
We're not rushing in.

00:16:18.257 --> 00:16:20.286
All right, listen,
keep me here,

00:16:20.321 --> 00:16:22.350
but let the students go.

00:16:23.982 --> 00:16:25.747
Get all their
fucking phones.

00:16:25.782 --> 00:16:27.878
Give me your phones. Let's go.
Give me your phones!

00:16:27.913 --> 00:16:30.808
Siobhan, do another
perimeter check, all right?

00:16:30.842 --> 00:16:32.672
Check every window.

00:16:32.707 --> 00:16:34.870
Any movement in any room,
you radio in, all right?

00:16:40.391 --> 00:16:41.788
She all right?

00:16:41.823 --> 00:16:43.518
She's still coming around.

00:16:47.547 --> 00:16:49.443
Oh, shit.

00:17:21.469 --> 00:17:24.164
Hey!
How we doing?

00:17:24.198 --> 00:17:27.594
They got fucking TV cameras
set up out there.

00:17:27.628 --> 00:17:30.390
This shit's getting
out of control.

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:36.616
Time to talk.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.079
Talk to who?

00:17:47.303 --> 00:17:48.635
You're on this, huh?

00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:50.931
I got the call from Harrisburg.
I was the closest man.

00:17:50.965 --> 00:17:53.329
I'm working at scrambling
a SWAT team from Philly.

00:17:53.363 --> 00:17:55.528
- All right.
- Where's Hood?

00:17:55.562 --> 00:17:57.259
He's out of town
on personal business.

00:17:57.293 --> 00:17:59.557
We're trying to reach him,
but I can handle this.

00:17:59.591 --> 00:18:01.853
<i>- Brock.</i>
- Go for Lotus.

00:18:01.887 --> 00:18:04.516
<i>I've got Janie Kendall,</i>
<i>the mayor's wife, on the line.</i>

00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:06.514
- <i>She's with the gunmen.</i>
- Put her through.

00:18:06.548 --> 00:18:09.510
<i>Janie, this is Brock Lotus.</i>
<i>You okay?</i>

00:18:10.908 --> 00:18:12.838
<i>Janie?</i>

00:18:14.523 --> 00:18:16.753
Tell him it's simple.

00:18:16.788 --> 00:18:20.150
He says to tell you
it's simple.

00:18:21.815 --> 00:18:23.811
We want a car
and an easy way out.

00:18:23.845 --> 00:18:26.209
They want a car
with a way out.

00:18:26.244 --> 00:18:28.173
We want it within an hour.

00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:31.036
They want it
within an hour.

00:18:34.368 --> 00:18:37.137
Or bad things
will happen in here.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.951
Or bad things will happen.

00:18:41.986 --> 00:18:44.855
Janie, is everyone
all right in there?

00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:48.592
Just tell him
to get the fucking car.

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:50.160
Who's with you?

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:52.663
<i>Get the fucking car.</i>

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:09.847
A gangster named Kassin
killed my father.

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:11.927
<i>I heard soon after</i>
<i>that he'd left Ukraine</i>

00:19:11.952 --> 00:19:13.895
<i>and gone to Kunda.</i>

00:19:13.969 --> 00:19:18.072
I went there,
but I couldn't find him.

00:19:18.106 --> 00:19:22.108
Then a few years later,

00:19:22.143 --> 00:19:26.045
I was in Yalta on business.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.248
I turned the corner

00:19:28.282 --> 00:19:31.084
and there was Kassin

00:19:31.118 --> 00:19:33.987
<i>carrying a bottle of wine.</i>

00:19:35.656 --> 00:19:37.857
We saw each other
at the same moment.

00:19:37.891 --> 00:19:41.360
It was like two old friends
running into each other.

00:19:44.264 --> 00:19:47.632
I gutted him like a fish
right there in the street.

00:19:49.335 --> 00:19:54.039
That night I drank
his wine with my dinner.

00:20:27.468 --> 00:20:29.369
<i>We break from</i>
<i>the regular program</i>

00:20:29.403 --> 00:20:31.537
<i>and go live to Banshee,</i>
<i>Pennsylvania.</i>

00:20:31.572 --> 00:20:33.438
Fuck!

00:20:33.473 --> 00:20:34.726
<i>We're here outside</i>
<i>Banshee High School</i>

00:20:34.751 --> 00:20:36.574
<i>in Banshee, Pennsylvania.</i>

00:20:36.575 --> 00:20:39.410
<i>So far what we have to report</i>
<i>is that a pair of armed gunmen</i>

00:20:39.445 --> 00:20:41.951
<i>have taken hostages here</i>
<i>in the school's gymnasium</i>

00:20:41.985 --> 00:20:43.853
<i>after fleeing a robbery</i>
<i>gone wrong.</i>

00:20:43.887 --> 00:20:46.922
<i>We know at least one person</i>
<i>has been killed at this time.</i>

00:20:46.956 --> 00:20:49.558
<i>One hostage posted a video</i>
<i>on her Facebook page</i>

00:20:49.592 --> 00:20:52.327
<i>and we have that footage.</i>

00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:54.862
<i>The police confirm</i>
<i>that they have been in contact</i>

00:20:54.897 --> 00:20:56.698
<i>with the gunmen, but are</i>
<i>releasing no information</i>

00:20:56.732 --> 00:20:59.100
<i>regarding the identity</i>
<i>of the men...</i>

00:21:04.506 --> 00:21:06.206
We are close, no?

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.908
Just 15 miles.

00:21:16.682 --> 00:21:19.916
These are all the Lances
that Alma could find in our system.

00:21:19.951 --> 00:21:22.452
<i>Lance McManus,</i>
<i>Lance Hershler,</i>

00:21:22.486 --> 00:21:25.788
- <i>Lance Mangan.</i>
- Him. Mangan.

00:21:25.823 --> 00:21:27.323
Jesus, I remember him.

00:21:27.358 --> 00:21:28.798
He was a point guard
back in the day.

00:21:28.826 --> 00:21:30.326
- A golden boy.
- Yeah, not anymore.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.628
He shot that cashier
like it was target practice.

00:21:32.662 --> 00:21:34.663
Brock!
Brock!

00:21:34.698 --> 00:21:36.499
- What's going on?
- All right, listen, listen.

00:21:36.533 --> 00:21:37.900
I talked to Janie.
She's okay.

00:21:37.934 --> 00:21:39.634
All right?
Gordon, hey.

00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:41.336
Deva's inside.
She had detention.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.538
- We know.
- Where's the sheriff?

00:21:43.572 --> 00:21:45.492
What do we know?
What steps are you taking, Brock?

00:21:45.507 --> 00:21:47.407
Gordon, come on.
Dan, please.

00:21:47.442 --> 00:21:50.010
Just stay back.
Stay back behind the barrier.

00:21:50.044 --> 00:21:52.812
For your own safety,
all right?

00:21:56.616 --> 00:21:58.284
Come on, Carrie,
pick up.

00:22:13.534 --> 00:22:15.801
What?

00:22:17.404 --> 00:22:18.804
Wait, what?

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:21.606
What the fuck
are you doing?

00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:23.175
<i>Are you fucking with her?</i>

00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:27.512
- No.
- Yes, you are. You're fucking with her.

00:22:27.546 --> 00:22:29.481
Instead of trying
to get us out of here,

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:31.349
<i>you're acting</i>
<i>like a fucking asshole.</i>

00:22:31.383 --> 00:22:32.225
<i>Fuck you.</i>

00:22:32.386 --> 00:22:35.024
<i>Why'd you have to shoot</i>
<i>that goddamn cashier?</i>

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.454
He was reaching
for something.

00:22:37.488 --> 00:22:39.087
I said I was sorry.

00:22:39.121 --> 00:22:41.384
Yeah, well, are you sorry
for all of this shit, huh?

00:22:41.419 --> 00:22:42.985
Because that's on you, too.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.488
You know, you don't fucking
think shit through.

00:22:49.126 --> 00:22:51.427
Can we focus here?

00:22:55.831 --> 00:22:57.932
<i>The police confirm</i>
<i>that they have been in contact</i>

<i>or the nature</i>

Don't worry.

00:23:43.572 --> 00:23:45.806
Fuck.

00:23:51.112 --> 00:23:53.112
Fuck.

00:23:53.147 --> 00:23:56.115
Oh, fucking spectacular.

00:23:59.086 --> 00:24:00.520
How did you find me?

00:24:00.554 --> 00:24:02.722
I have a tracker
on your phone.

00:24:05.258 --> 00:24:06.759
Come on!

00:24:48.161 --> 00:24:50.429
Car?

00:24:56.698 --> 00:24:58.532
- No!
- Enough of this bullshit, man.

00:24:58.566 --> 00:25:00.266
We've got to get
the fuck out of here.

00:25:00.301 --> 00:25:02.234
Get the fuck
out of my way.

00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:05.071
- Please.
- You don't need to look at this.

00:25:05.105 --> 00:25:06.839
You don't need-- fuck!

00:25:06.874 --> 00:25:09.409
Just don't fuck with me.
Don't look.

00:25:09.443 --> 00:25:11.211
Please.

00:25:11.245 --> 00:25:13.112
No, please.

00:25:13.147 --> 00:25:15.648
Please don't.
They'll give you what you want.

00:25:15.682 --> 00:25:18.616
- I know they will.
- So will you.

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:22.351
You bastard!
Bastard!

00:25:24.687 --> 00:25:28.855
<i>Don't. Don't!</i>

00:25:38.064 --> 00:25:40.932
- Yeah?
<i>- Car's here for you now.</i>

00:25:40.967 --> 00:25:43.034
I'll call you back.

00:25:48.773 --> 00:25:51.375
Come on.
We'll pick this up later.

00:26:11.225 --> 00:26:13.426
Hey, hey. I've been trying--
hey, hey, hey!

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.528
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
- Deva's in there?

00:26:15.562 --> 00:26:17.330
They're doing
everything they can.

00:26:20.133 --> 00:26:22.401
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Listen up.

00:26:22.435 --> 00:26:24.769
No, you listen.

00:26:24.804 --> 00:26:27.938
You're Lance Mangan.
I remember you.

00:26:29.674 --> 00:26:31.207
Who the fuck are you?

00:26:31.241 --> 00:26:34.576
Brock Lotus. I was a year
behind you in school.

00:26:34.611 --> 00:26:36.678
Yeah, well, I don't
remember you.

00:26:36.713 --> 00:26:39.617
Well, I remember
you were all-state.

00:26:39.651 --> 00:26:43.289
You started at point guard.
You called smart plays.

00:26:43.324 --> 00:26:45.358
See if you can call
a smart play now.

00:26:45.392 --> 00:26:47.126
All right?
Your car is here.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.760
You want it moved
up there by the door,

00:26:48.794 --> 00:26:50.427
I'm gonna need
something from you.

00:26:50.462 --> 00:26:53.397
Let's get the kids
out of there.

00:26:55.433 --> 00:26:56.967
I'll send out
four kids.

00:26:57.001 --> 00:26:59.635
Then you move the car
to the door.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.538
All right,
it's a deal.

00:27:05.441 --> 00:27:07.642
You four in the front,
you're leaving.

00:27:07.676 --> 00:27:09.944
One, two, three, four.
Get up.

00:27:09.978 --> 00:27:12.338
- Nathan, bring them to the door.
- Let's go. Come on, move.

00:27:12.347 --> 00:27:15.515
I said four.
Future Horse stays right here.

00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:18.985
She's coming with me.
I'm not leaving without her.

00:27:19.019 --> 00:27:21.754
It's okay, Beaty, go.

00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:24.157
Ah!

00:27:24.191 --> 00:27:26.025
- What the fuck?
- Run! Run!

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.528
Get back here!
Get back down!

00:27:28.562 --> 00:27:30.162
- Watch them!
- Sit down!

00:27:30.197 --> 00:27:31.831
- No! No!
- Wait a minute, teacher.

00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:38.503
Brock, can you please
give us an update?

00:27:38.537 --> 00:27:39.770
I'd like one, too.

00:27:45.676 --> 00:27:47.376
What's going on?
You going in?

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.278
<i>No. I just negotiated the release</i>
<i>of four of the kids.</i>

00:27:50.312 --> 00:27:52.246
Great.
Where are they?

00:27:54.049 --> 00:27:56.650
Um...

00:27:56.685 --> 00:27:58.118
Hood, these men
are willing to kill.

00:27:58.153 --> 00:27:59.987
You go in there
guns blazing,

00:28:00.021 --> 00:28:01.988
you're gonna have a handful
of dead children.

00:28:02.022 --> 00:28:03.657
Who said anything
about guns blazing?

00:28:03.691 --> 00:28:05.392
You can't walk
in there-- ah!

00:28:05.426 --> 00:28:07.627
Don't touch me.

00:28:10.697 --> 00:28:12.264
We follow
him in, right?

00:28:12.298 --> 00:28:14.633
I'm not following him anywhere.
He's insane.

00:28:14.667 --> 00:28:17.535
We stay to protocol.
We wait out here.

00:28:25.276 --> 00:28:26.943
What the fuck?

00:28:28.112 --> 00:28:29.779
I'm unarmed.

00:28:29.813 --> 00:28:32.048
Don't fucking move.

00:28:34.885 --> 00:28:37.486
I came in here to help
you work this out.

00:28:37.521 --> 00:28:39.288
Fuck you.

00:28:39.322 --> 00:28:41.023
You're in some
deep shit here, man.

00:28:41.058 --> 00:28:43.429
Lance, get back here!

00:28:44.865 --> 00:28:46.932
Where's Lance?

00:28:48.334 --> 00:28:50.335
Huh?

00:29:03.653 --> 00:29:05.386
Future Horse.

00:29:20.168 --> 00:29:22.202
You're not gonna
walk out of this.

00:29:22.237 --> 00:29:24.304
They won't let you go.

00:29:24.338 --> 00:29:27.174
They have to.
We have hostages.

00:29:27.208 --> 00:29:28.641
That doesn't matter anymore.

00:29:28.676 --> 00:29:30.076
That's gone.
You killed a man.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.245
I didn't kill anyone!

00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:35.247
- It was fucking Lance.
- I believe you.

00:29:36.382 --> 00:29:38.850
Lance killed him.
What's your name?

00:29:38.884 --> 00:29:40.485
You don't need to know
my fucking name.

00:29:40.519 --> 00:29:41.919
- It's Nathan.
- Shut the fuck up!

00:29:41.954 --> 00:29:43.921
- Hey, hey, hey, Nathan.
- Back the fuck up.

00:29:43.956 --> 00:29:45.622
- I can help you.
- Lance!

00:29:45.657 --> 00:29:48.625
Get the fuck back here!
Back up!

00:29:48.659 --> 00:29:51.428
Lance can't help you.
I can.

00:29:54.465 --> 00:29:55.932
Oh, my God!
Come on!

00:29:55.966 --> 00:29:57.900
Hey!

00:30:00.003 --> 00:30:02.471
Don't fucking move.

00:30:02.505 --> 00:30:06.608
I will fucking kill you.

00:30:09.478 --> 00:30:11.279
- I don't think so.
- Yes, I will.

00:30:11.313 --> 00:30:12.647
- No, not you.
- Yes, I will.

00:30:12.681 --> 00:30:14.582
- Not you, man.
- I will fucking kill you.

00:30:22.356 --> 00:30:23.889
You're no killer, Nathan.

00:30:23.924 --> 00:30:25.357
Yes, I am.

00:30:25.392 --> 00:30:28.794
- It's Lance.
- No.

00:30:28.828 --> 00:30:30.729
Lance--
he's the killer.

00:30:30.764 --> 00:30:34.166
No, I am a fucking killer.

00:30:37.604 --> 00:30:40.472
Shots fired.
We're going in.

00:30:40.506 --> 00:30:43.075
All of you up.
Out, now.

00:30:46.412 --> 00:30:48.513
- Hold your fire!
- It's the students.

00:30:48.548 --> 00:30:51.517
- <i>Get clear!</i>
- Stay down. Come on. Come on.

00:30:57.857 --> 00:30:59.657
- Where's Deva?
- I don't know.

00:30:59.692 --> 00:31:02.526
- Where's my daughter?
- She's inside.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.194
Go forward!

00:31:07.398 --> 00:31:10.500
Jamie.

00:31:10.534 --> 00:31:12.335
It's okay.

00:31:12.369 --> 00:31:15.571
Let's-- let's go home, okay?

00:31:33.584 --> 00:31:36.153
Get up, Future Horse.

00:31:36.187 --> 00:31:38.955
Nathan, I got 'em.
Nathan.

00:31:41.525 --> 00:31:44.795
Nathan.
Oh, no, no, no.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:50.066
No!

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.768
Oh, fuck.

00:31:52.803 --> 00:31:55.037
Let her go, Lance.

00:31:55.071 --> 00:31:57.338
- Drop your fucking gun.
- Not gonna happen.

00:31:57.373 --> 00:31:59.006
Stand down, Sheriff.

00:31:59.041 --> 00:32:01.943
- I'll fucking kill her!
- Let the girl go.

00:32:01.977 --> 00:32:03.978
I'll fucking blow
her head off!

00:32:04.012 --> 00:32:06.647
- Drop that fucking gun now.
<i>- Drop your weapon!</i>

00:32:06.681 --> 00:32:08.482
Get down the fucking
stairs right now!

00:32:08.516 --> 00:32:10.684
- Drop your weapon.
- Drop your fucking guns!

00:32:10.718 --> 00:32:13.319
- Get back!
- <i>Stand down.</i>

00:32:13.354 --> 00:32:15.789
<i>Drop your gun!</i>
<i>Drop it!</i>

00:32:15.823 --> 00:32:17.390
<i>Put it on the ground now!</i>

00:32:48.085 --> 00:32:50.519
Sheriff.
Are you injured?

00:32:50.554 --> 00:32:52.755
Uh, no.

00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:55.590
Good, then you
can tell me...

00:32:55.624 --> 00:32:57.758
<i>I defused the situation.</i>

00:33:03.364 --> 00:33:04.765
I did what I had to do.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.903
You just endangered the lives
of eight innocent people.

00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:13.741
Listen,

00:33:13.776 --> 00:33:15.710
I'll give you
everything you need,

00:33:15.744 --> 00:33:18.679
I promise,
in my report.

00:33:23.285 --> 00:33:25.219
Welcome to my world.

00:33:47.607 --> 00:33:49.507
<i>Hey.</i>

00:33:54.379 --> 00:33:57.013
Alma told me
I'd find you here.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:01.783
That guy, the cashier,

00:34:01.818 --> 00:34:04.019
he just woke up today
and went to work.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.887
He really
had no idea that--

00:34:06.922 --> 00:34:09.923
Hey, you are
an excellent cop

00:34:09.958 --> 00:34:11.191
and an excellent man.

00:34:11.225 --> 00:34:12.792
If there was something
you could have done,

00:34:12.827 --> 00:34:14.661
you would have done it.

00:34:21.068 --> 00:34:22.469
I'm pregnant.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.847
<i>The police have confirmed</i>
<i>that the two gunmen</i>

00:34:35.881 --> 00:34:37.515
<i>were both killed</i>
<i>inside the school,</i>

00:34:37.549 --> 00:34:38.950
<i>that the location</i>
<i>is secure,</i>

00:34:38.984 --> 00:34:40.851
<i>and that all eight of</i>
<i>the former hostages</i>

00:34:40.886 --> 00:34:43.483
<i>are alive and being attended</i>
<i>by medical professionals.</i>

00:34:43.517 --> 00:34:45.879
<i>The gunmen were involved</i>
<i>in a botched robbery</i>

00:34:45.913 --> 00:34:47.313
<i>at a drugstore</i>
<i>earlier today.</i>

00:34:47.348 --> 00:34:49.248
<i>A local police deputy</i>
<i>intervened</i>

00:34:49.282 --> 00:34:51.015
<i>and pursued them here</i>
<i>to the high school,</i>

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.684
<i>at which point the gunmen</i>
<i>took eight hostages.</i>

00:35:01.188 --> 00:35:04.823
So now you want to tell me who
the hell put the cuffs on you?

00:35:07.159 --> 00:35:08.825
Long story.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.294
- Sugar.
- <i>Kai.</i>

00:35:11.328 --> 00:35:13.595
Sheriff.

00:35:13.629 --> 00:35:15.663
I thought
I'd find you here.

00:35:15.698 --> 00:35:17.965
Still patching
yourself up, I see.

00:35:17.999 --> 00:35:20.933
I'll survive.

00:35:20.968 --> 00:35:22.734
You did good work
today, Sheriff.

00:35:22.769 --> 00:35:24.269
This town owes you
a real debt.

00:35:28.207 --> 00:35:30.675
It seems I'm in
your debt as well.

00:35:30.709 --> 00:35:33.576
The DA formally dropped
all charges today.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:35.842
Apparently the key piece
of evidence disappeared.

00:35:35.876 --> 00:35:38.343
Hmm, and a key witness.

00:35:39.545 --> 00:35:41.178
This is the first
I've heard about that.

00:35:45.648 --> 00:35:47.648
Well, congratulations.

00:35:47.683 --> 00:35:50.250
You're a free man.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.655
You know, generally,
Banshee is a pretty quiet town.

00:35:57.689 --> 00:36:01.221
But after you arrived,
it's been one thing after another.

00:36:01.256 --> 00:36:04.290
It's almost as if you
brought it all with you.

00:36:05.358 --> 00:36:07.892
"And behold a pale rider,

00:36:07.926 --> 00:36:11.160
and his name that sat
upon him was Death.

00:36:11.195 --> 00:36:14.396
And hell followed with him."

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.263
Revelations 6:8.

00:36:16.298 --> 00:36:20.066
Yeah, I've never had much patience
for people who quote scripture.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.601
This is God's country.

00:36:21.635 --> 00:36:23.115
You'd better acquire
the taste for it.

00:36:23.136 --> 00:36:25.503
You have
a good night, Sugar.

00:36:25.538 --> 00:36:27.338
Sheriff.

00:36:27.372 --> 00:36:29.472
You, too, Kai.

00:36:36.877 --> 00:36:39.511
Are you ever gonna
tell me that story?

00:36:41.313 --> 00:36:43.546
Come on, you and Proctor.

00:36:44.681 --> 00:36:47.349
What would we be
without our secrets?

00:37:31.841 --> 00:37:34.075
Are you gonna shoot me?

00:37:44.716 --> 00:37:47.617
I'm sorry.

00:38:10.497 --> 00:38:14.031
I'm so, so sorry.

00:38:25.171 --> 00:38:27.371
Shh.

00:41:42.641 --> 00:41:44.441
Made them all myself.

00:41:44.476 --> 00:41:46.742
Strawberry, pecan,

00:41:46.776 --> 00:41:48.808
and this one's called
triple chocolate.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.077
The dark one.

00:41:55.182 --> 00:41:57.917
You're not from around here,
I can tell you that much.

00:41:59.185 --> 00:42:01.219
Everyone passes through
here at some point.

00:42:03.723 --> 00:42:06.257
And I would have
remembered you.

00:42:07.392 --> 00:42:10.994
So, that accent,
where are you from?

00:42:12.863 --> 00:42:15.431
I'd rather talk about
where I am.
