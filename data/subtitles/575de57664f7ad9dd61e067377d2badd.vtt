WEBVTT

00:02:22.262 --> 00:02:23.862
Fuck me.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.402
Hi, Job.

00:02:32.436 --> 00:02:35.904
- <i>You're out.</i>
- I'm out.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:40.175
Listen, I know why you're here,

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.877
but I cannot help you.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:44.012
Hey!

00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:48.414
Just give me the address, Job.

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.613
Why are you even
assuming I know how to--

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.710
no, no, no, no!
Motherfucker!

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.457
Quit breaking my shit.

00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:01.530
Baby, you know how this works.

00:03:01.564 --> 00:03:05.870
The trail is cold.

00:03:05.904 --> 00:03:10.325
Okay, okay, okay!
Just... stop the carnage.

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.048
You've got the whole world
in front of you

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:29.789
and you're going
to the one place

00:03:29.823 --> 00:03:31.966
you absolutely should not go.

00:05:04.926 --> 00:05:07.446
<i>What, are you crazy?!</i>

00:05:52.436 --> 00:05:54.187
Hey!

00:07:15.481 --> 00:07:18.582
Sync and corrections by n17t01

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.896
<i>Morning, everyone.</i>

00:08:22.554 --> 00:08:26.430
I've reviewed the defense's
motion to dismiss.

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:29.952
And based on the evidence,
or the lack thereof,

00:08:29.987 --> 00:08:31.648
it's my opinion
that the prosecution

00:08:31.683 --> 00:08:33.948
- cannot sustain the burden for a trial...
- Are you kidding me?

00:08:33.983 --> 00:08:35.247
- Your Honor--
- <i>...so I'm finding for the defense.</i>

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:37.549
<i>Case dismissed.</i>

00:08:39.555 --> 00:08:42.960
<i>You can't take this</i>
<i>to trial, Gordon.</i>

00:08:42.994 --> 00:08:44.866
You should be thanking me

00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:46.842
for saving you
the embarrassment.

00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:06.860
- Gordon.
- Jackson.

00:09:06.895 --> 00:09:09.897
That a judge in your pocket
or you just happy to see me?

00:09:15.903 --> 00:09:17.670
Mr. Mayor.

00:09:24.424 --> 00:09:28.193
- Jesus Christ, Gordon.
- Oh, pace yourself, Dan.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.430
Our day will come.

00:09:32.465 --> 00:09:36.467
Guys like Kai Proctor
don't go down easy.

00:09:43.941 --> 00:09:46.074
<i>Carrie.</i>

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.744
Hey.

00:09:51.647 --> 00:09:54.281
You'll get him
next time, Counselor.

00:09:54.315 --> 00:09:57.316
Yeah, I am ready
for this day to be over.

00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:01.186
Again?

00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:03.321
Yeah.

00:10:04.656 --> 00:10:06.257
<i>It's nothing
to freak out about.</i>

00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:08.425
<i>We're not freaking out.
We're just talking to you.</i>

00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:11.461
My point is we don't solve
our problems with violence.

00:10:11.496 --> 00:10:13.296
I just completed another level.

00:10:13.331 --> 00:10:15.364
Yeah, it happens
every day, Dad.

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:17.532
I just can't believe that
you kicked your teacher.

00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:20.101
- Substitute teacher.
- Oh, well, it's okay, then.

00:10:20.135 --> 00:10:22.402
He's a perv, Mom.
He tried to see down my shirt.

00:10:22.436 --> 00:10:24.671
Well, with a shirt like that,
it doesn't take much trying.

00:10:24.706 --> 00:10:26.372
- So it's my fault?
- Gordon.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.673
So if I get molested
by a teacher,

00:10:27.708 --> 00:10:29.208
- you'll just blame it on my shirt?
- No, no. Go.

00:10:29.242 --> 00:10:31.676
- Deva, come on.
- Okay, all right.

00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:35.480
Max, honey, you have your inhaler?

00:10:37.883 --> 00:10:40.384
Dr. Welling referred Max
to another pulmonologist.

00:10:40.418 --> 00:10:42.051
We have an appointment
next week.

00:10:42.085 --> 00:10:44.955
Okay. Great.

00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:48.557
- Is your shoulder bad today?
- Ah, it's just the usual.

00:10:48.591 --> 00:10:50.525
It'll be all right.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.093
I think I might grab a shower.

00:10:52.127 --> 00:10:53.860
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:11:07.764 --> 00:11:11.698
That's Beaty. Later.

00:11:41.506 --> 00:11:44.474
- You're late, bitch.
- Whatever, skank.

00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:46.409
<i>So, are you in shit</i>
<i>with your parents?</i>

00:11:46.443 --> 00:11:48.677
Yeah, when am I not?

00:12:27.287 --> 00:12:28.888
Howdy.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:35.496
I'm gonna go with shitty day

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.064
and whiskey neat.

00:12:37.099 --> 00:12:39.200
Whiskey's fine.

00:12:45.706 --> 00:12:47.373
And one for yourself.

00:12:55.116 --> 00:12:57.317
Are you coming or going?

00:12:58.953 --> 00:13:01.221
I'm still working that out.

00:13:06.361 --> 00:13:09.860
That's me, Sugar Bates

00:13:09.894 --> 00:13:12.160
<i>in the cruiserweight years.</i>

00:13:12.195 --> 00:13:14.429
When'd you drop him?

00:13:14.464 --> 00:13:16.398
Fifth?

00:13:16.432 --> 00:13:18.099
Eighth.

00:13:18.134 --> 00:13:22.536
He was a southpaw.
They take longer.

00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:24.705
See, it was a title fight.

00:13:24.739 --> 00:13:26.973
I held the belt for 18 months.

00:13:27.008 --> 00:13:30.109
I used to hang it
right up there.

00:13:30.144 --> 00:13:31.377
<i>You know?</i>

00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:33.713
<i>A good conversation piece.</i>

00:13:33.747 --> 00:13:36.048
But with this tough
economy, I had to pawn it

00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:39.885
a little while back
to pay for the leaking taps.

00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:43.589
That's a shame.

00:13:43.624 --> 00:13:46.159
Where are you from?

00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:50.629
Different places.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:59.269
Where'd you sit?

00:14:03.975 --> 00:14:05.442
Roscoe.

00:14:06.577 --> 00:14:09.045
I did eight years at Allenwood.

00:14:11.815 --> 00:14:13.983
You look fresh.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.021
Freedom.

00:14:21.392 --> 00:14:22.992
Freedom.

00:14:37.605 --> 00:14:40.073
Always this quiet around here?

00:14:42.042 --> 00:14:45.245
Well, let's stimulate
the local economy.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.181
Next round's on me.

00:14:47.215 --> 00:14:48.648
All right.

00:14:48.683 --> 00:14:52.620
All you tourists
buying me drinks today.

00:14:52.654 --> 00:14:55.022
I'm not a tourist.

00:14:57.293 --> 00:14:59.028
My name is Lucas Hood.

00:14:59.062 --> 00:15:03.270
And come Monday, I'm being
sworn in as the new sheriff.

00:15:03.304 --> 00:15:05.473
Congratulations.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.710
<i>Or should we say good luck?</i>

00:15:08.778 --> 00:15:10.879
<i>I'll take both, thanks.</i>

00:15:10.914 --> 00:15:12.949
<i>I spent nine years as sheriff</i>
<i>up in Church, Oregon.</i>

00:15:12.983 --> 00:15:15.218
You ever heard of it?

00:15:15.252 --> 00:15:18.789
<i>Yeah, I'm not surprised.</i>
<i>It's the armpit of the West.</i>

00:15:18.823 --> 00:15:20.624
<i>This is my first day east.</i>

00:15:20.658 --> 00:15:22.959
I just drove clear
across the country.

00:15:22.993 --> 00:15:24.928
There's less to see
than you'd think.

00:15:24.962 --> 00:15:28.970
I thought the sheriff
had to be elected.

00:15:29.004 --> 00:15:30.841
<i>Usually, but under</i>
<i>certain circumstances,</i>

00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:32.709
<i>the mayor can</i>
<i>bring in a ringer.</i>

00:15:32.744 --> 00:15:35.645
<i>He and Sheriff Morgan</i>
<i>are the ones who hired me, so...</i>

00:15:35.679 --> 00:15:37.781
I was looking forward to
meeting them when I got here.

00:15:37.815 --> 00:15:39.684
<i>Yeah, well,
that'd be quite a trick</i>

00:15:39.718 --> 00:15:41.752
since he died last Tuesday.

00:15:41.786 --> 00:15:43.687
Liver cancer.

00:15:44.822 --> 00:15:46.957
I think he thought
he had more time.

00:15:50.028 --> 00:15:52.028
<i>Aw, shit.</i>

00:15:55.465 --> 00:15:57.699
<i>Your boss know you're here?</i>

00:15:57.733 --> 00:16:01.767
Don't worry about him.
You know the drill.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.673
Look at this guy.

00:16:14.777 --> 00:16:16.644
Excuse me.

00:16:16.678 --> 00:16:18.545
Are we disturbing you?

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.980
No, not at all.

00:16:20.014 --> 00:16:22.416
This is just a very good steak.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.584
<i>And I know that once I stand
up to deal with you fellas--</i>

00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:28.387
<i>well, maybe you'll come quietly
or maybe I'll have to kill you--</i>

00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:30.422
<i>but either way, this steak</i>
<i>is gonna get cold.</i>

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:31.924
<i>And you can always</i>
<i>reheat a steak,</i>

00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.293
but it's never quite the same.

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.494
Hmm?

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:42.500
You got some balls on
you, motherfucker.

00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:50.639
Sheriff's Department.
I'll take that gun now.

00:16:50.674 --> 00:16:52.641
<i>No, you drop your fucking gun.</i>

00:17:02.084 --> 00:17:04.585
That's the new STI, isn't it?

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:06.854
- That's a hard gun to get.
- Who the fuck is this guy?

00:17:06.888 --> 00:17:09.859
- You sit your ass down.
- All right, hear me out, Sheriff.

00:17:09.894 --> 00:17:12.229
- They got you outgunned.
- Damn straight we do.

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:14.198
While on the other hand,
if he shoots,

00:17:14.232 --> 00:17:16.066
one of you boys is dead

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.168
or shitting in a bag
the rest of his life.

00:17:18.202 --> 00:17:19.169
For what?

00:17:19.203 --> 00:17:21.004
The 200 bucks
Sugar has in the register

00:17:21.038 --> 00:17:22.672
<i>at 4:00 p.m.</i>
<i>on a Tuesday? Come on.</i>

00:17:22.707 --> 00:17:26.009
So, Sheriff, why don't you
let them take the cash?

00:17:26.043 --> 00:17:27.610
Just let them take it.

00:17:27.645 --> 00:17:29.445
I'll buy enough drinks
to make him whole.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.648
Everyone goes home happy.
What do you say?

00:17:34.084 --> 00:17:35.917
<i>Come on.</i>

00:17:39.521 --> 00:17:41.923
Ah!

00:17:41.957 --> 00:17:44.057
Oh, God!

00:18:19.055 --> 00:18:21.189
<i>Am I dead?</i>

00:18:22.558 --> 00:18:23.958
Yeah.

00:18:23.992 --> 00:18:26.762
It's my first day in town.

00:18:26.796 --> 00:18:29.598
Shit!

00:18:31.434 --> 00:18:33.535
Sorry.

00:18:33.569 --> 00:18:38.238
I hope my mother
was right about God.

00:18:43.777 --> 00:18:46.745
Jesus ripshit Christ.

00:18:50.382 --> 00:18:52.750
This is what you call
in the Bible

00:18:52.784 --> 00:18:56.120
a "clusterfuck
of epic proportions."

00:18:57.989 --> 00:19:02.660
Two cons, three corpses,
one of them a cop.

00:19:02.694 --> 00:19:05.029
I don't like that math.

00:19:06.364 --> 00:19:09.133
<i>You'd better get out of here.</i>

00:19:14.137 --> 00:19:16.872
Well, they would have
killed me same as him.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:20.910
The least I can do
is give you a head start.

00:19:20.944 --> 00:19:22.513
What about you?

00:19:22.548 --> 00:19:25.016
<i>I got a few tricks.</i>

00:19:26.084 --> 00:19:28.152
<i>Go on, now.</i>
<i>Get out of here.</i>

00:19:56.415 --> 00:19:58.017
Hi, Ana.

00:20:03.158 --> 00:20:05.091
How did you find me?

00:20:07.761 --> 00:20:10.763
It was Job.

00:20:12.132 --> 00:20:14.267
It's a nice house.

00:20:16.603 --> 00:20:19.271
Yeah. It seems, um...

00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:22.773
<i>uh, solid.</i>

00:20:22.808 --> 00:20:25.276
So, what do you have, two kids?

00:20:27.245 --> 00:20:30.046
- Yes.
- Yeah?

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.580
How old?

00:20:31.614 --> 00:20:34.449
My son is eight.

00:20:35.785 --> 00:20:39.153
My daughter is 13.

00:20:39.187 --> 00:20:41.321
Hmm.

00:20:42.623 --> 00:20:44.457
She looks older.

00:20:52.831 --> 00:20:55.298
I can smell
your perfume from here.

00:20:56.768 --> 00:21:00.036
Please, you're gonna
have to leave.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.138
Please. Please.

00:21:04.007 --> 00:21:05.706
Ana.

00:21:05.774 --> 00:21:07.942
I'm not Ana anymore.

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:09.810
My name is Carrie.

00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:15.515
Where were you?

00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:17.917
- I tried to visit.
- No. 15 years.

00:21:17.952 --> 00:21:20.219
- I drove up to those gates.
- You were here playing fucking house?

00:21:20.287 --> 00:21:21.654
You have no idea
how many times.

00:21:21.688 --> 00:21:23.789
Don't you tell me that.
Where the fuck were you?!

00:21:23.823 --> 00:21:26.557
I don't have to
justify myself to you.

00:21:26.625 --> 00:21:28.860
I have responsibilities.

00:21:28.894 --> 00:21:30.995
I have children.

00:21:32.497 --> 00:21:34.431
Okay?

00:21:35.733 --> 00:21:40.503
I have a husband who loves me.

00:21:41.372 --> 00:21:43.172
No.

00:21:47.211 --> 00:21:50.614
- It's me.
- Don't. I can't.

00:21:53.517 --> 00:21:55.918
You could have led Rabbit
straight to me.

00:21:55.953 --> 00:21:59.020
What the fuck
were you thinking?

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.328
Okay.

00:22:09.197 --> 00:22:11.899
You moved on.
I get it.

00:22:14.735 --> 00:22:18.271
So give me my cut and
you'll never see me again.

00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:22.642
I don't have the diamonds.

00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:25.077
What? What?

00:22:25.111 --> 00:22:26.712
<i>After we screwed</i>
<i>Rabbit like that</i>

00:22:26.746 --> 00:22:29.348
- <i>and you had gotten caught--</i>
- No, no, I did not get caught!

00:22:29.382 --> 00:22:31.149
- There were two of us there that night!
- Shh, shh!

00:22:31.217 --> 00:22:34.152
- I led them away from you!
- I know.

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:36.821
Listen, I tried to fence them.

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:41.825
The guys I found, these real
bottom-feeders-- Serbians...

00:22:45.162 --> 00:22:46.796
they saw me coming.

00:22:49.299 --> 00:22:51.867
You're telling me
you got rolled?

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:57.072
Does it look like
I'm sitting on $10 million?

00:23:08.182 --> 00:23:10.416
Mm.

00:23:14.154 --> 00:23:16.689
I don't get the girl.

00:23:16.756 --> 00:23:18.924
I don't get the money.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.896
I spent 15 years
picturing this day,

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.333
and I gotta tell you, this is
not how I saw it playing out.

00:23:28.367 --> 00:23:32.036
I'm so sorry.
I am so fucking sorry.

00:23:33.338 --> 00:23:36.640
<i>- Hey, babe, you out here?</i>
- Shit.

00:23:38.375 --> 00:23:40.876
Yeah.
Hey, honey.

00:23:40.911 --> 00:23:42.777
Raccoon.

00:24:01.362 --> 00:24:03.229
Christ.

00:24:03.264 --> 00:24:04.664
You trying to kill me?

00:24:04.698 --> 00:24:07.366
Have you picked a spot yet?

00:24:10.069 --> 00:24:11.570
Ha.

00:24:11.604 --> 00:24:14.038
You one of them
complicated types.

00:24:14.073 --> 00:24:16.174
Is that it?

00:24:19.878 --> 00:24:22.980
Nah, some people just don't
know simple when they see it.

00:24:24.349 --> 00:24:26.417
Sh...

00:24:37.897 --> 00:24:40.665
Don't seem right

00:24:40.699 --> 00:24:43.734
burying the sheriff
with that pond scum.

00:24:43.768 --> 00:24:46.269
What, do you wanna
dig him his own hole?

00:24:46.304 --> 00:24:49.239
Yeah, that'd be
the Christian thing to do.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.744
That you?
- No.

00:25:25.173 --> 00:25:27.772
- Hello?
- <i>Sheriff Hood, it's Mayor Dan Kendall.</i>

00:25:27.807 --> 00:25:30.039
<i>Am I catching you</i>
<i>at a bad time?</i>

00:25:34.646 --> 00:25:36.479
<i>Sheriff?</i>

00:25:36.514 --> 00:25:38.581
<i>Are you there?</i>

00:25:43.687 --> 00:25:46.455
- Yeah, this is Hood.
- <i>How's the drive going?</i>

00:25:50.691 --> 00:25:52.425
A lot less to see
than you'd think.

00:25:52.492 --> 00:25:54.226
<i>Well, I just wanted</i>
<i>to confirm tomorrow.</i>

00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:57.230
<i>You'll be in town by then?</i>

00:25:57.264 --> 00:25:58.831
- Should be, yeah.
- <i>Great.</i>

00:25:58.864 --> 00:26:01.766
<i>So that's 1:00</i>
<i>at Miles' Diner.</i>

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.867
<i>I look forward to finally</i>
<i>meeting you in person.</i>

00:26:03.902 --> 00:26:07.301
Great.
I'll see you then.

00:26:08.702 --> 00:26:12.370
Now tell me you got some
kind of master plan here.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:23.180
Well, I usually just
get by with my charm.

00:26:32.188 --> 00:26:34.555
- Hishi Salon.
<i>- I need a favor.</i>

00:26:34.589 --> 00:26:37.024
And I need $5,000
for all the shit you broke.

00:26:37.058 --> 00:26:40.160
- I'll make it 10.
- <i>Fuck you!</i>

00:26:40.195 --> 00:26:42.195
Speak.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.264
I need to become someone else.

00:26:44.298 --> 00:26:45.965
Honey child, don't we all?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.299
<i>Someone specific.</i>

00:26:49.835 --> 00:26:51.301
Name?

00:26:51.336 --> 00:26:52.936
Lucas Hood

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.471
<i>of Church, Oregon.</i>

00:26:54.538 --> 00:26:56.605
Shouldn't be a problem.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.873
Unless he's
a motherfuckin' cop.

00:26:58.908 --> 00:26:59.941
Are you kidding me?

00:26:59.975 --> 00:27:01.542
I need it quick, Job.

00:27:01.576 --> 00:27:03.577
<i>Baby, you just sat for 15 years</i>

00:27:03.611 --> 00:27:06.279
because you were the most
notorious thief in the country.

00:27:06.314 --> 00:27:08.247
Now you want to play cop?

00:27:08.282 --> 00:27:11.483
- Can you do it? - <i>I mean, I have to hack</i>
<i>law enforcement databases,</i>

00:27:11.518 --> 00:27:13.418
<i>swap out fingerprints</i>
<i>and photo IDs,</i>

00:27:13.453 --> 00:27:16.721
- <i>find any news article that might have run a picture--</i>
- So you can't do it?

00:27:16.756 --> 00:27:19.790
Suck my tit, bitch!
Of course I can do it.

00:27:21.092 --> 00:27:22.759
Take a couple days.

00:27:22.794 --> 00:27:25.562
As for the credentials, I can get you
the papers, but the badge itself--

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.330
I got the badge.

00:27:27.364 --> 00:27:29.699
<i>I don't even wanna know.</i>

00:27:31.869 --> 00:27:34.770
You know, some cons,
the minute they get out,

00:27:34.804 --> 00:27:37.138
they're just trying
like hell to get back in.

00:27:37.173 --> 00:27:39.641
I'm not going back.

00:27:39.675 --> 00:27:41.910
Yeah, well, you got
a revolutionary way

00:27:41.944 --> 00:27:44.245
of staying out of trouble.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.946
Here.

00:27:45.981 --> 00:27:48.682
The pickup belonged
to the sheriff.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.087
Thanks.

00:27:58.925 --> 00:28:01.192
Hey.

00:28:02.628 --> 00:28:04.996
You got a place to stay?

00:28:49.936 --> 00:28:52.069
No one's ever stolen
from Rabbit.

00:29:44.248 --> 00:29:46.050
Okay.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.525
Hey, go in back
and stay out of sight.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.295
- What for?
- Go now.

00:30:07.978 --> 00:30:10.112
Morning, Sugar.

00:30:10.147 --> 00:30:12.482
Kai.

00:30:23.625 --> 00:30:25.893
How are the headaches?

00:30:25.928 --> 00:30:28.495
Did those Mexican
painkillers I got you help?

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:31.632
They did.
Thanks.

00:30:34.702 --> 00:30:38.037
What brings you around?

00:30:38.071 --> 00:30:40.439
I seem to have misplaced
two of my men--

00:30:40.473 --> 00:30:43.141
Randall and Munson.

00:30:43.209 --> 00:30:46.110
Munson, the bald one?

00:30:46.145 --> 00:30:48.013
<i>One of the boys thought</i>
<i>they might have been</i>

00:30:48.047 --> 00:30:49.882
<i>headed out this way</i>
<i>yesterday afternoon.</i>

00:30:49.916 --> 00:30:51.817
Well, they didn't come here.

00:30:51.851 --> 00:30:54.052
If they did,
I'd have taken notice.

00:30:55.521 --> 00:30:58.323
If any of my employees
ever stepped out of line,

00:30:58.358 --> 00:31:01.426
hassled you in any way,
I'd expect you to call me.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:05.463
<i>What I mean is I wouldn't want you to
take matters into your own hands.</i>

00:31:05.497 --> 00:31:08.232
Look at me.

00:31:08.266 --> 00:31:12.069
Nobody runs from a fight
faster than an old fighter.

00:31:15.572 --> 00:31:18.374
<i>What happened</i>
<i>to your title fight?</i>

00:31:18.408 --> 00:31:20.742
Oh, I knocked it
off the hook the other night,

00:31:20.776 --> 00:31:22.477
busted up the frame.

00:31:22.511 --> 00:31:24.278
I'm having it redone.

00:31:32.252 --> 00:31:34.553
- Thanks for the drink.
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

00:31:34.587 --> 00:31:37.722
You let me know if you need
any more of those painkillers.

00:32:08.011 --> 00:32:09.812
That's some car.

00:32:09.846 --> 00:32:13.115
Look, if you're thinking of
stealing from Kai Proctor,

00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:16.217
you may as well take a bullet and
put it in your head right now.

00:32:16.252 --> 00:32:19.587
Kai Proctor.
There is a name.

00:32:19.621 --> 00:32:22.086
<i>What the man</i>
<i>doesn't own, he runs.</i>

00:32:22.121 --> 00:32:26.947
What he doesn't run,
he burns to the ground.

00:32:26.982 --> 00:32:29.882
<i>He seemed to like you</i>
<i>well enough.</i>

00:32:31.451 --> 00:32:34.419
We go back a ways.

00:32:34.454 --> 00:32:37.522
- Uh-huh.
- <i>Listen.</i>

00:32:37.557 --> 00:32:40.992
<i>You don't seem like the kind
of guy who takes advice...</i>

00:32:43.028 --> 00:32:45.930
but I'm gonna try anyway.

00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:52.469
There's $400.
Take it and go.

00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:56.305
- I can't.
- Look around.

00:32:56.339 --> 00:32:59.141
- You're free, man.
- No.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:04.178
Pay you back in a few days.

00:34:22.965 --> 00:34:25.566
Good to meet you.
Lucas Hood.

00:34:27.502 --> 00:34:30.203
Lucas Hood.
How are-- how--

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:54.691
Excuse me.

00:34:54.725 --> 00:34:56.392
- Say hi to Amy.
- Thank you.

00:34:56.426 --> 00:35:00.595
- Sheriff Hood?
- That's right.

00:35:00.629 --> 00:35:02.596
It's great to meet you.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.497
Yeah, you, too.

00:35:05.532 --> 00:35:07.266
I know, I look young,

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.201
but that's just because I am.

00:35:10.303 --> 00:35:12.270
Have a seat.

00:35:29.945 --> 00:35:33.574
Job, two suits, badly tailored.

00:35:33.609 --> 00:35:35.709
They're looking for you.

00:35:36.777 --> 00:35:38.377
Cops?

00:35:39.712 --> 00:35:41.711
Let's hope so.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.180
I want all the backup
drives in the car now.

00:36:01.021 --> 00:36:03.520
Keep the engine running.

00:36:13.355 --> 00:36:16.688
Gentlemen, we don't
actually open till 10:00,

00:36:16.722 --> 00:36:18.422
but if you'll follow me
back upstairs,

00:36:18.456 --> 00:36:20.791
I'm sure we can find
somewhere to fit you in.

00:36:20.825 --> 00:36:25.000
Down here might be better for the
private nature of our inquiry.

00:36:25.034 --> 00:36:27.935
Inquiry? Hmm.

00:36:27.969 --> 00:36:30.069
May I see some ID?

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.372
This ain't a badge.

00:36:41.406 --> 00:36:44.740
No... it's not.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:54.743
Fucking slope cunt!

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:59.810
We work for Mr. Rabbit.

00:37:03.546 --> 00:37:05.046
Sweet fuck.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.449
The guy you're looking for
came in a couple of days ago.

00:37:08.484 --> 00:37:10.051
And what did he want?

00:37:10.085 --> 00:37:13.920
Just the usual, man--
credit cards, IDs.

00:37:13.954 --> 00:37:17.157
- Where is he now?
- I'll tell Mr. Rabbit whatever he wants,

00:37:17.192 --> 00:37:19.530
but I've no idea.

00:37:21.768 --> 00:37:23.568
O-Okay, okay, okay!

00:37:23.635 --> 00:37:25.735
I'll get the file!
It's in the safe.

00:37:30.436 --> 00:37:33.169
That would be helpful.

So I pissed off some
people when I hired you.

00:38:05.677 --> 00:38:06.977
But every sheriff
that we've had,

00:38:07.011 --> 00:38:08.344
including Morgan,

00:38:08.378 --> 00:38:10.144
ended up on Proctor's payroll,

00:38:10.179 --> 00:38:11.811
so I needed an outsider.

00:38:13.312 --> 00:38:15.572
So you brought me in here
to take down this one guy?

00:38:15.607 --> 00:38:17.395
This Proctor?

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:20.088
He's not just one guy,
all right?

00:38:20.122 --> 00:38:21.851
There's not a criminal
enterprise around here

00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:24.249
that doesn't start
or end in his pockets.

00:38:25.447 --> 00:38:28.311
Now, I know you don't
work till Monday,

00:38:28.343 --> 00:38:31.572
but I wanna show you the Cadi.

00:38:31.607 --> 00:38:33.205
The Cadi?

00:38:35.869 --> 00:38:37.933
The old Sheriff's Department
burned down three years ago.

00:38:37.967 --> 00:38:39.497
City Hall was pretty strapped.

00:38:39.531 --> 00:38:42.062
Froemer's Cadillac had just
gone under, so we got creative.

00:38:42.097 --> 00:38:44.193
<i>Girl, you're
gonna leave that man</i>

00:38:44.228 --> 00:38:45.689
and you're gonna
leave that man tonight.

00:38:45.723 --> 00:38:47.419
- Mm-mm.
- Alma.

00:38:47.453 --> 00:38:50.450
Um, I'll call you later.

00:38:50.484 --> 00:38:52.348
Meet Lucas Hood.

00:38:52.382 --> 00:38:54.480
- Good to meet you, Alma.
- Sheriff Hood.

00:38:54.514 --> 00:38:56.545
Great to meet you.

00:38:58.179 --> 00:38:59.610
Mm-hmm.

00:39:00.144 --> 00:39:04.040
- Afternoon, Mayor.
- This is Lucas Hood.

00:39:05.808 --> 00:39:07.405
<i>This is Emmett Yawners.</i>

00:39:07.439 --> 00:39:09.934
<i>He's one of the top 10 rushers
of all time at Penn State.</i>

00:39:09.969 --> 00:39:11.832
- Good to meet you.
- Welcome to the BSD.

00:39:11.867 --> 00:39:13.432
<i>And this is Brock Lotus,</i>

00:39:13.467 --> 00:39:15.097
<i>our longest-serving member</i>
<i>of the department.</i>

00:39:15.131 --> 00:39:16.529
That right?

00:39:16.564 --> 00:39:18.461
How are you doing, Sheriff?

00:39:18.495 --> 00:39:20.957
You fucking fascist!

00:39:20.992 --> 00:39:22.557
I didn't even do anything.

00:39:22.592 --> 00:39:25.321
Oh, yeah, you're
a model citizen.

00:39:26.756 --> 00:39:28.226
You try and fight me again,

00:39:28.261 --> 00:39:31.229
I remove your
fucking testicles.

00:39:31.263 --> 00:39:32.961
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:39:32.995 --> 00:39:35.460
<i>This is Lucas Hood.
It's your new boss.</i>

00:39:35.495 --> 00:39:38.225
Well, shit, Danny, you
could have said so sooner.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.525
I'm Siobhan Kelly.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.692
- My name's Peter.
- Shut the fuck up!

00:39:41.726 --> 00:39:44.551
Siobhan, I was thinking maybe you could
show the sheriff the town of Banshee.

00:39:44.586 --> 00:39:47.878
Oh, I'd love to, but I have to
write up Charlie Sheen over here.

00:39:50.811 --> 00:39:52.744
Actually, I'd love a tour

00:39:52.778 --> 00:39:55.343
from the longest-serving
member of the department.

00:39:56.809 --> 00:39:59.108
All right, so why don't we start
on the outskirts of town?

00:39:59.142 --> 00:40:02.007
There's an Indian casino.
Work our way back.

00:40:03.941 --> 00:40:06.006
Did I catch you on a bad day

00:40:06.041 --> 00:40:08.506
or you always this cheerful?

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.705
Aw, shit.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.337
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:40:13.372 --> 00:40:15.237
Moody boys build furniture

00:40:15.271 --> 00:40:17.436
and the Amish mills have been
driving down their prices.

00:40:17.471 --> 00:40:19.934
We've, uh-- we've had incidents.

00:40:22.934 --> 00:40:25.333
<i>They won't hit back.</i>

00:40:25.368 --> 00:40:27.733
Oh, you've seen "Witness."
Yeah, that's great.

00:40:27.767 --> 00:40:29.298
Why don't you let me
handle this, huh?

00:40:29.333 --> 00:40:31.897
- Yeah, sure.
- Hood, Hood!

00:40:34.064 --> 00:40:36.763
<i>Whoops!</i>

00:40:39.962 --> 00:40:41.827
We don't--
we want no trouble.

00:40:43.328 --> 00:40:44.460
Hey!

00:40:46.662 --> 00:40:49.159
Why don't we all
just take a moment,

00:40:49.193 --> 00:40:50.991
talk about this?

00:40:51.026 --> 00:40:52.758
Who the fuck are you?

00:40:52.825 --> 00:40:56.122
Lucas Hood.
I'm the new sheriff.

00:40:56.157 --> 00:40:58.588
Hey, Lotus, I thought
you were supposed

00:40:58.623 --> 00:41:00.387
to take over
when Morgan kicked.

00:41:00.422 --> 00:41:02.986
Yeah, well, you and me both.

00:41:04.454 --> 00:41:06.218
Hey! Cole.

00:41:06.253 --> 00:41:08.718
That's enough.

00:41:08.753 --> 00:41:10.484
I'm sure your wife's
got better things to do

00:41:10.518 --> 00:41:12.049
than bail your ass
out of jail today.

00:41:12.084 --> 00:41:15.616
<i>- I'm not through messing with them.</i>
- Yeah, you are.

00:41:15.651 --> 00:41:19.248
If you're the sheriff,
why aren't you in uniform?

00:41:19.282 --> 00:41:21.214
I don't start till Monday.

00:41:21.248 --> 00:41:23.480
So there's nothing stopping us

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:25.946
from fucking your shit up
today, then, huh?

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.979
Yeah. I hoped you'd
make that connection.

00:41:29.013 --> 00:41:33.045
- All right.
- Easy, Deputy. I got this.

00:41:34.045 --> 00:41:36.477
So, come on, Cole...

00:41:38.077 --> 00:41:39.908
fuck my shit up.

00:41:42.443 --> 00:41:44.408
All right, just to be clear,

00:41:44.443 --> 00:41:46.141
I'm gonna be pounding a civilian--

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:51.473
<i>Come on, motherfucker.</i>
<i>Get up!</i>

00:41:56.339 --> 00:41:59.103
<i>Get his ass, Cole.</i>
<i>Get his ass!</i>

00:42:01.605 --> 00:42:03.670
That's enough, Cole.

00:42:03.705 --> 00:42:06.536
Mr. Proctor.

00:42:09.402 --> 00:42:11.702
Your four-on-one advantage
wasn't enough?

00:42:12.669 --> 00:42:15.476
You needed this?

00:42:18.691 --> 00:42:20.894
Come on, guys.

00:42:22.229 --> 00:42:24.564
Hold on.

00:42:24.598 --> 00:42:26.099
These men are on a schedule.

00:42:26.133 --> 00:42:29.636
Why don't you boys help
them load their wagons?

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:32.505
Yes, sir.
Come on.

00:42:39.713 --> 00:42:41.915
You are?

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:47.690
- Lucas Hood.
- The new sheriff.

00:42:48.959 --> 00:42:52.861
Fucking Dutchie.
This isn't over.

00:42:59.368 --> 00:43:01.235
Kai Proctor.

00:43:01.269 --> 00:43:03.904
Sorry if I stepped
on your toes there.

00:43:03.939 --> 00:43:08.175
- Mr. Proctor, what exactly do you do?
- I'm in meats.

00:43:11.045 --> 00:43:14.180
Why don't you stop by
the slaughterhouse?

00:43:14.214 --> 00:43:16.883
<i>I'll set you up</i>
<i>with some nice steaks.</i>

00:43:37.767 --> 00:43:39.903
_

00:43:42.462 --> 00:43:44.701
_

00:43:58.355 --> 00:44:01.757
Hey, Lotus, I'm gonna walk.

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:09.897
You're welcome, by the way.

00:44:41.456 --> 00:44:43.357
<i>♪ Are you happy</i>
<i>with yourself? ♪</i>

00:44:43.391 --> 00:44:45.992
<i>♪ Are you happy with</i>
<i>yourself? ♪</i>

00:44:46.026 --> 00:44:48.961
<i>♪ I hope you're happy,</i>
<i>but I don't think so ♪</i>

00:44:48.995 --> 00:44:51.029
<i>♪ I don't think so, I don't ♪</i>

00:44:51.064 --> 00:44:54.599
- <i>♪ Are you happy with yourself? ♪</i>
- I-- I have to go.

00:44:54.633 --> 00:44:56.601
Come on, stay with me.

00:44:56.636 --> 00:44:59.170
- See you later.
- What?

00:45:02.074 --> 00:45:03.707
But I love you.

00:45:06.311 --> 00:45:08.312
- Whoa! You okay?
- Yeah, my bad.

00:45:08.346 --> 00:45:10.147
Okay.
It's all right.

00:45:15.284 --> 00:45:17.819
13 years old, my ass.

00:45:17.853 --> 00:45:21.355
Hey. Sorry,
you dropped this.

00:45:21.389 --> 00:45:24.289
- Thanks.
- Shouldn't you be in school?

00:45:24.324 --> 00:45:26.459
Yeah, I should.

00:45:26.494 --> 00:45:29.161
Can't your boyfriend
take you back?

00:45:29.196 --> 00:45:30.796
Who says he's my boyfriend?

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:32.396
Well, I hope he's not
your brother.

00:46:09.856 --> 00:46:11.857
P&Ls.

00:46:11.958 --> 00:46:14.359
Our numbers are down
at both strip clubs?

00:46:14.394 --> 00:46:17.796
With the economy what it is...

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:20.698
Men will pay for tits
until they're broke or dead.

00:46:20.732 --> 00:46:22.333
Fix that, Burton.

00:46:33.443 --> 00:46:35.844
You said you wanted to see me?

00:46:38.314 --> 00:46:40.281
It's a relatively
humane procedure.

00:46:40.316 --> 00:46:44.384
We stun the beasts with a
pneumatic captive bolt gun--

00:46:44.452 --> 00:46:46.019
one of these.

00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:49.155
One bolt to the brain
does the trick.

00:46:49.223 --> 00:46:53.058
Then we cut them
and they quietly bleed out.

00:46:53.093 --> 00:46:56.128
- Listen, um--
- The Old Order Pennsylvania Dutch

00:46:56.162 --> 00:46:57.996
don't like being
called "Dutchies."

00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:59.397
It's derisive.

00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:03.066
I believe I heard you call my
father a "fucking Dutchie."

00:47:04.902 --> 00:47:07.537
I was just running my mouth.

00:47:07.571 --> 00:47:09.972
I-I didn't know
he was your father.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.021
Now you take your teeth
and put them back

00:47:28.056 --> 00:47:30.825
in your fat, bigoted mouth
and get the fuck out of here.

00:47:30.859 --> 00:47:33.694
Back in your mouth, I said.

00:47:43.574 --> 00:47:46.377
Why don't you see
Mr. Moody out?

00:48:03.194 --> 00:48:04.895
You.

00:49:09.086 --> 00:49:11.922
- They get your size wrong?
- No, I'm good.

00:49:15.359 --> 00:49:17.093
Bring the pants to the
Martinizing over by the diner.

00:49:17.128 --> 00:49:18.595
They'll take them in for you.

00:49:18.629 --> 00:49:21.030
All right, thanks.
I'll do that.

00:49:22.965 --> 00:49:25.067
You got any family
coming to the swearing in?

00:49:25.101 --> 00:49:28.936
No, I don't have any family,

00:49:28.971 --> 00:49:31.342
coming or not.

00:49:32.446 --> 00:49:34.815
Well, we'll all be there

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:36.884
and at Proctor's
reception after.

00:49:36.918 --> 00:49:38.553
Reception?

00:49:38.587 --> 00:49:40.053
Say what you will
about Proctor,

00:49:40.088 --> 00:49:42.390
but the man knows
how to throw a party.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.260
There.

00:49:45.294 --> 00:49:47.295
Now that's what
a sheriff looks like.

00:50:00.307 --> 00:50:03.743
- I do solemnly swear...
- I do solemnly swear...

00:50:03.777 --> 00:50:06.545

so help me God.

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:16.205
So help me God.

00:51:25.081 --> 00:51:27.382
Understated as usual.

00:51:27.416 --> 00:51:29.550
You just charged the man
with racketeering.

00:51:29.618 --> 00:51:32.853
Now you're at his party.
Only in Banshee.

00:51:50.537 --> 00:51:52.804
Sheriff Hood.

00:51:52.839 --> 00:51:55.106
Mr. Proctor.

00:51:55.141 --> 00:51:56.908
This is some shindig.

00:51:56.942 --> 00:51:59.343
You'll find that Banshee
is not the backwater town

00:51:59.378 --> 00:52:01.812
it sometimes pretends to be.

00:52:01.847 --> 00:52:04.847
You enjoy yourself.

00:52:05.982 --> 00:52:07.849
I'll check in on you soon.

00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:10.318
Sure.

00:52:10.352 --> 00:52:13.287
Sheriff Hood.
Gordon Hopewell.

00:52:13.321 --> 00:52:16.757
- We met at the swearing in.
- <i>The DA, right?</i>

00:52:16.791 --> 00:52:20.093
<i>Honey, come over
and meet our new sheriff.</i>

00:52:22.229 --> 00:52:23.996
Hi.

00:52:25.832 --> 00:52:28.267
Lucas Hood.
Great to meet you.

00:52:30.236 --> 00:52:32.503
Carrie?

00:52:32.537 --> 00:52:34.739
I'm sorry.
I'm not myself tonight.

00:52:34.773 --> 00:52:36.874
No?
Who are you, then?

00:52:40.444 --> 00:52:42.912
Good to meet you,
Mrs. Hopewell.

00:52:46.617 --> 00:52:49.085
I'm telling you, there's
something wrong with that guy.

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:52.622
He went through the Moody boys
like they were cardboard.

00:52:52.656 --> 00:52:56.292
So you're upset that our
sheriff knows how to fight?

00:52:56.326 --> 00:52:58.394
It wasn't just
fighting, Emmett.

00:52:58.428 --> 00:53:00.528
It was fucking combat.

00:53:01.563 --> 00:53:03.197
Sheriff Hood,

00:53:03.232 --> 00:53:05.732
I'd like you to meet
Chief Benjamin Longshadow

00:53:05.767 --> 00:53:07.634
of the local Kinaho Tribe,

00:53:07.668 --> 00:53:10.303
a good friend and a great
man revered in Banshee.

00:53:10.337 --> 00:53:12.104
Good to meet you, Chief.

00:53:12.138 --> 00:53:14.139
Likewise, Sheriff Hood.

00:53:14.173 --> 00:53:16.741
My son Alex.

00:53:16.775 --> 00:53:18.042
- Hi.
- Hey, Alex.

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:21.945
When you get settled,
my tribal council

00:53:21.979 --> 00:53:24.448
wants to honor you
with a dinner.

00:53:24.483 --> 00:53:26.550
<i>On the reservation, of course.</i>

00:53:26.585 --> 00:53:29.453
Yeah, um, that sounds great.

00:53:29.488 --> 00:53:32.289
You'll-- you'll excuse me?

00:53:51.305 --> 00:53:53.273
A sheriff?

00:53:53.307 --> 00:53:55.342
Are you kidding me?

00:53:56.477 --> 00:53:59.011
They have a great health plan.

00:53:59.046 --> 00:54:01.847
Pshh, you're not gonna
need it in prison.

00:54:03.115 --> 00:54:05.950
You used to have
more faith in me.

00:54:11.624 --> 00:54:13.024
Why are you doing this?

00:54:13.058 --> 00:54:15.459
You know why.

00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:24.968
Come here for a sec.

00:54:31.742 --> 00:54:33.110
I don't believe this.

00:54:33.144 --> 00:54:34.711
It's an old Sargent safe.

00:54:34.745 --> 00:54:37.347
I can't get in there, but you
could do it in your sleep.

00:54:37.381 --> 00:54:40.082
- Jesus.
- Come on, it's the least you can do.

00:54:40.117 --> 00:54:41.550
No.

00:54:41.584 --> 00:54:43.118
What you're doing, it's crazy.

00:54:43.153 --> 00:54:45.253
- If you don't end it, I will.
- Yeah?

00:54:45.288 --> 00:54:47.488
You're in no position
to blow any whistles,

00:54:47.522 --> 00:54:49.857
Mrs. Hopewell.

00:54:49.891 --> 00:54:52.025
You're insane.

00:55:08.707 --> 00:55:12.376
Honey, I'm feeling
pretty tired.

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:14.077
You're preaching to the choir.

00:55:14.112 --> 00:55:16.480
I think we've stayed
long enough.

00:55:20.551 --> 00:55:22.718
Kai, thanks for having us.

00:55:22.753 --> 00:55:24.287
Sure.

00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:26.122
Glad you stopped by.

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:28.490
This isn't awkward at all.

00:55:30.826 --> 00:55:32.492
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.223
Proctor!

00:55:37.457 --> 00:55:39.191
<i>- Get here.</i>
<i>- Just stay there.</i>

00:55:42.028 --> 00:55:43.928
Get down, get down.

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:46.030
<i>Please.</i>

00:55:46.064 --> 00:55:48.466
Dutchie motherfucker!

00:56:26.866 --> 00:56:28.868
<i>Taxi!</i>

00:56:54.057 --> 00:56:56.092
Knight to rook four.

00:56:58.195 --> 00:56:59.862
Yours.

00:57:02.799 --> 00:57:04.800
Pishak to queen three.

00:57:05.768 --> 00:57:07.636
Yours.

00:57:10.673 --> 00:57:15.610
So, no documents,

00:57:15.678 --> 00:57:18.179
no software, no hardware.

00:57:19.548 --> 00:57:23.617
Everything in this
hairdresser's, burned?

00:57:23.651 --> 00:57:25.451
Yes.

00:57:27.954 --> 00:57:30.889
Queen to knight two.
Checkmate.

00:57:42.735 --> 00:57:45.736
You will find them both...

00:57:45.771 --> 00:57:47.838
quickly.
