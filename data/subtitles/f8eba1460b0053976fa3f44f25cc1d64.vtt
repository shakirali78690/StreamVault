00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:12.609
Hey, hey! Stick to the trees.

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:15.712
<i>Right there on the ground!</i>

00:00:19.078 --> 00:00:20.976
Run!

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:24.945
<i>Baby!</i>

00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:17.915
I think he knows.

00:01:19.384 --> 00:01:23.086
No, he doesn't know. He can't.

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:26.055
By the time he figures out
we're not coming back,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.224
we'll be long gone.

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:38.634
Hey.

00:01:40.903 --> 00:01:43.238
We risk our lives
every time we steal for him.

00:01:45.274 --> 00:01:47.274
Why not risk our lives for us?

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:50.677
No one's ever
stolen from Rabbit.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.547
He doesn't know.

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:07.692
Everything will be fine.

00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:35.848
Are we back
on track, Mr. Hanson?

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.384
We're still playing catch-up after
that power failure yesterday,

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.454
but I'll keep them late and we
should be caught up by Sunday.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.891
Friday.

00:03:46.628 --> 00:03:49.664
Okay. Friday. I'm on it.

00:03:53.102 --> 00:03:55.603
Oh, I'm on it, motherfucker.

00:04:27.741 --> 00:04:29.976
Get down here.

00:04:44.626 --> 00:04:47.429
You know for a fact
the Yoders are out of town?

00:04:47.463 --> 00:04:49.632
Yeah. Away till Tuesday.

00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:51.767
Okay.

00:05:04.048 --> 00:05:06.283
Get out of here.

00:05:12.592 --> 00:05:14.727
- Good to go, boys.
- All right.

00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:16.829
<i>It's an original masonry house.</i>

00:05:16.897 --> 00:05:18.264
All the houses
in this neighborhood

00:05:18.298 --> 00:05:21.267
came up in the late 1920s.

00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:23.268
If you wanted to paint
over this green in here.

00:05:23.303 --> 00:05:26.305
- But I'll be here...
- Excuse me just a moment.

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.140
Mrs. Hopewell, good morning.

00:05:28.174 --> 00:05:29.908
What are you doing here?

00:05:29.943 --> 00:05:32.210
Same as everyone else.

00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:34.747
I'm looking to put down roots.

00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.616
This room has great
morning light.

00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:40.887
Would you like
to see the kitchen?

00:05:40.921 --> 00:05:42.822
Sure.

00:05:45.393 --> 00:05:47.294
What the fuck are you doing?

00:06:03.214 --> 00:06:06.283
- You've been training.
- What the fuck are you doing?

00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:08.018
This is my life.

00:06:08.053 --> 00:06:10.421
- Ana.
- My name is Carrie.

00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:13.525
Either way, I still love you.

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.965
If that's true, then you'll
leave here and never come back.

00:06:22.301 --> 00:06:24.536
<i>Carrie?</i>

00:06:26.106 --> 00:06:29.041
Um, your phone.

00:06:29.075 --> 00:06:32.111
Shit! Okay. Hello?

00:06:35.048 --> 00:06:36.415
Nice kitchen.

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:38.584
<i>Mrs. Hopewell,</i>
<i>this is Principal Merrick.</i>

00:06:38.618 --> 00:06:40.170
<i>I'm calling to let
you know that Deva</i>

00:06:40.171 --> 00:06:41.721
<i>is not in school
again this morning.</i>

00:06:41.755 --> 00:06:44.090
<i>I wanted to check</i>
<i>if she was feeling ill.</i>

00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:46.026
No, no, she's not,

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.895
but I can assure you
she's going to be.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.765
<i>I hope she's okay.</i>
<i>Please let us know. Thanks.</i>

00:06:58.473 --> 00:07:00.541
<i>Hey, it's Deva.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

00:07:00.576 --> 00:07:02.477
<i>Or don't.</i>

00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:03.945
Deva, where are you?

00:07:05.581 --> 00:07:07.649
<i>♪ You're so, so fine ♪</i>

00:07:07.683 --> 00:07:11.654
<i>♪ Even when you're dropping,</i>
<i>you're down like a man ♪</i>

00:07:13.356 --> 00:07:16.658
<i>♪ I know you're just a boy,</i>
<i>but I could hardly tell ♪</i>

00:07:16.692 --> 00:07:19.260
<i>♪ And no one really cares. ♪</i>

00:07:22.531 --> 00:07:24.632
Whoo!

00:07:39.783 --> 00:07:41.917
<i>How's it going?</i>

00:07:56.466 --> 00:07:58.802
<i>Yo, man. Are we putting
the Skulls with these?</i>

00:07:58.836 --> 00:08:01.504
<i>- Just sort it and show me.</i>
- Reed?

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:07.777
- Hey, Hanson.
- Hey, Reed.

00:08:07.812 --> 00:08:09.112
Who the fuck are they?

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.780
It's okay. They're cool.

00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:12.915
Move.

00:08:14.685 --> 00:08:19.188
Well, come here, cool girls.

00:08:36.408 --> 00:08:38.643
Go on.

00:08:53.993 --> 00:08:57.896
<i>You ask and Arno delivers.</i>

00:08:57.931 --> 00:08:59.798
The Red Skull stamp
as promised.

00:08:59.832 --> 00:09:02.567
Pretty sweet, huh?

00:09:02.602 --> 00:09:04.102
Now if we can just
settle up our account...

00:09:04.137 --> 00:09:05.804
- Hey.
- Ah! Ow, man!

00:09:05.838 --> 00:09:08.306
Hey, fuckhead, you got high
while you're working for me?

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.610
- Are you fucking crazy?
- No way, man. I'm a professional.

00:09:11.644 --> 00:09:14.012
<i>So you're not
tripping right now?</i>

00:09:14.047 --> 00:09:15.380
I'm straight, man.

00:09:15.415 --> 00:09:17.716
Look at me.

00:09:24.323 --> 00:09:26.358
Fucking tweaker.
Get him out of here.

00:09:26.392 --> 00:09:28.861
Move it.

00:09:28.895 --> 00:09:31.397
Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'm gonna kick your ass.

00:09:31.431 --> 00:09:33.933
- Fuck you.
- Yo, chill out, man. Get off of me.

00:09:33.967 --> 00:09:36.269
<i>Fuck off! Go!</i>

00:09:42.142 --> 00:09:43.843
Come here.

00:09:47.882 --> 00:09:49.649
Come here.

00:10:41.937 --> 00:10:44.071
Are you cool?

00:10:50.579 --> 00:10:52.246
What is it?

00:10:52.281 --> 00:10:54.682
Some of the pills aren't pure.

00:10:54.716 --> 00:10:56.517
- There's caffeine in them.
- You know what?

00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:58.252
How about you leave
the chemistry to me

00:10:58.286 --> 00:11:00.788
and just go back
and make the fucking pills?

00:11:10.433 --> 00:11:11.800
What's going on?

00:11:21.144 --> 00:11:23.079
You're in.

00:11:28.185 --> 00:11:30.219
Midnight tomorrow
at Yoder's barn.

00:11:30.254 --> 00:11:33.089
- You know it?
- Yeah.

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:38.029
And you girls will
spread the word, right?

00:11:38.063 --> 00:11:40.664
Hells yeah, we will.

00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:44.669
Let's go, Deva.

00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:55.547
- Hey.
- Sheriff.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.152
You're late.

00:11:59.186 --> 00:12:00.687
What, do I need
a note from home?

00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:02.155
Couldn't reach you
on your radio.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.756
I'm here now. What do you need?

00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:05.258
What I need, what we need,

00:12:05.293 --> 00:12:06.827
is a sheriff
that answers his radio.

00:12:06.861 --> 00:12:09.029
All right?

00:12:09.063 --> 00:12:10.464
I'll take that
under advisement.

00:12:10.498 --> 00:12:12.566
Look, I don't know how
you did things in Oregon...

00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:14.936
- Shut up, Brock.
- <i>What?</i>

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.740
- What the hell did you just say to me?
- I won't tell you twice.

00:12:28.718 --> 00:12:30.786
Mr. Proctor.

00:12:32.589 --> 00:12:34.590
<i>There he is.</i>

00:12:34.624 --> 00:12:36.592
That looks painful.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.027
I'll survive.

00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:40.729
May I have a word in private?

00:12:51.775 --> 00:12:54.176
Kobe steaks. My best.

00:12:54.244 --> 00:12:55.944
Thank you.

00:12:55.979 --> 00:12:57.846
Well, you saved my life.

00:12:57.881 --> 00:13:00.015
I was just doing my job.

00:13:02.252 --> 00:13:05.121
<i>I'm sure by now you've</i>
<i>gleaned that there are people</i>

00:13:05.155 --> 00:13:07.523
in Banshee,
our young mayor among them,

00:13:07.558 --> 00:13:09.959
who would have been happy
to see me go down.

00:13:11.563 --> 00:13:12.964
Yeah, why is that?

00:13:12.998 --> 00:13:14.499
Oh...

00:13:14.533 --> 00:13:17.769
some people find my business
practices a little aggressive.

00:13:17.803 --> 00:13:19.771
I don't deny it.

00:13:19.805 --> 00:13:22.040
Not everyone shares
my vision for this town.

00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:24.710
But that's a talk
for another time.

00:13:24.744 --> 00:13:29.147
The reason I stopped in is to warn
you about the Moody brothers.

00:13:29.182 --> 00:13:31.116
Warn me?

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.085
Yeah, they might be swimming in
the shallow end of the gene pool,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.122
but they're a fiercely
loyal clan.

00:13:36.156 --> 00:13:38.692
Been in this town
almost as long as my people.

00:13:38.726 --> 00:13:40.427
And they will be out for blood.

00:13:41.762 --> 00:13:43.896
I'll keep my eye out.

00:13:45.065 --> 00:13:47.634
Sheriff, I wouldn't
be bothering you

00:13:47.668 --> 00:13:50.537
if I didn't think you have a
serious problem on your hands.

00:13:50.571 --> 00:13:52.105
I don't deny your abilities.

00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:55.608
It's just that your hands
are tied by this office,

00:13:55.642 --> 00:13:59.280
whereas I have a talent
for resolving problems

00:13:59.314 --> 00:14:01.649
like this one quietly.

00:14:05.353 --> 00:14:08.022
I appreciate your concern,

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:10.791
but...

00:14:10.826 --> 00:14:13.929
I think I'll just take
things as they come.

00:14:16.265 --> 00:14:19.567
It could be that I'm speaking
globally here, Sheriff,

00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:22.136
beyond the Moody situation.

00:14:22.171 --> 00:14:25.507
You see, I've got a good number
of local business interests

00:14:25.574 --> 00:14:28.042
that need to be kept
running smoothly.

00:14:28.077 --> 00:14:31.446
These interests can occasionally
generate difficulties,

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.315
but they also
generate revenues.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.684
Significant revenues.

00:14:39.053 --> 00:14:41.855
What do you want, Mr. Proctor?

00:14:43.225 --> 00:14:46.696
I might ask you the same
question, Sheriff Hood.

00:14:52.836 --> 00:14:55.038
I'm good.

00:14:58.242 --> 00:15:00.643
But thank you.

00:15:07.752 --> 00:15:10.020
You take care of that.

00:15:10.054 --> 00:15:13.491
It could go bad pretty fast.

00:15:50.562 --> 00:15:52.630
- Where's my fucking money?
<i>- You'll get it.</i>

00:15:52.664 --> 00:15:55.499
- Where'd you land?
- <i>In hell.</i>

00:15:55.533 --> 00:15:58.736
Do you have any idea
what I'm surrounded by?

00:15:58.804 --> 00:16:00.705
Skee-fucking-Ball,

00:16:00.739 --> 00:16:02.406
cotton-fucking-candy,

00:16:02.441 --> 00:16:04.976
and sea-fucking-gulls.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:07.845
Is that a cape?

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.316
This is Diane von
Furstenberg, chica.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.083
Shoo. Go get pregnant.

00:16:15.554 --> 00:16:19.156
- So?
- <i>Bitch, you got lucky on this one.</i>

00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:23.128
Lucas Hood had virtually
no living relatives,

00:16:23.163 --> 00:16:25.597
an estranged ex-wife
and son he ain't seen in years.

00:16:25.632 --> 00:16:27.866
<i>I couldn't even find</i>
<i>any close friends.</i>

00:16:27.901 --> 00:16:29.802
And he ain't into
the grid, neither.

00:16:29.836 --> 00:16:31.570
No Facebook, no Twitter.

00:16:31.604 --> 00:16:34.039
Your cover is good for now.

00:16:34.107 --> 00:16:36.241
<i>Except...</i>

00:16:36.276 --> 00:16:37.743
Except what?

00:16:37.778 --> 00:16:39.512
Except that being where you are

00:16:39.546 --> 00:16:42.448
makes you the dumbest
bitch that I know!

00:16:42.483 --> 00:16:44.617
Oh, not you, Snooki.

00:16:47.989 --> 00:16:52.160
So, how's she look?

00:16:55.064 --> 00:16:57.131
She looks good.

00:17:47.652 --> 00:17:49.753
Hold it!

00:17:50.989 --> 00:17:53.657
Sorry, it's been
that kind of week.

00:17:53.692 --> 00:17:56.160
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:17:56.194 --> 00:17:58.095
Then let's have some fun.

00:18:09.709 --> 00:18:12.477
You and your Hula Poppers.

00:18:12.512 --> 00:18:15.447
If you're after serious game,
you'd better come ready.

00:18:15.481 --> 00:18:17.049
Live bait is the way to go.

00:18:17.083 --> 00:18:20.185
Nah. I've been winning
fishing derbies

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.956
since you were
a speck of sperm.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.593
I hear you have the new sheriff
living over your garage.

00:18:28.195 --> 00:18:32.232
Huh? Seems kind of strange for
an ex-con renting to a lawman.

00:18:34.035 --> 00:18:36.469
Doesn't it bother you?

00:18:36.504 --> 00:18:40.073
Apparently not as much
as it bothers you.

00:18:40.107 --> 00:18:43.977
At some point, I might begin
to question your loyalty.

00:18:45.646 --> 00:18:49.850
No, I'm just
a broken-down ex-con.

00:18:49.885 --> 00:18:52.754
I don't choose sides.

00:18:55.458 --> 00:18:57.859
Kai.

00:18:57.893 --> 00:19:01.796
You talk about serious game?

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.599
Hood is serious game.

00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:06.668
<i>Like you've never seen.</i>

00:19:06.703 --> 00:19:10.339
So if you come for him,
you'd better come ready.

00:19:14.745 --> 00:19:16.946
Take care of yourself, Sugar.

00:19:18.015 --> 00:19:19.916
Yeah, you, too.

00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:35.132
No, no, no. You can't
be here tonight.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.168
And yet I am.

00:19:37.202 --> 00:19:38.703
Cole Moody's wake.

00:19:38.737 --> 00:19:41.372
<i>His brothers</i>
<i>are drunker than usual,</i>

00:19:41.406 --> 00:19:42.874
if that's possible.

00:19:42.908 --> 00:19:44.408
Now, we've already
had two fistfights.

00:19:44.443 --> 00:19:46.110
That's just between
family members.

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:48.513
Can I at least get a sandwich?
Hey.

00:19:48.547 --> 00:19:50.582
All right.

00:19:50.616 --> 00:19:52.751
All right, just...

00:19:55.521 --> 00:19:57.355
Whatever it takes
to get you out of here.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.991
Look, here. Come on, take 'em.

00:19:59.026 --> 00:20:02.228
Come on, eat 'em. Plenty
more where that came from.

00:20:02.263 --> 00:20:04.196
Come on.

00:20:04.231 --> 00:20:06.532
All right?

00:20:35.361 --> 00:20:37.562
Sheriff Hood.

00:20:37.596 --> 00:20:39.697
Yeah?

00:20:42.668 --> 00:20:44.703
You don't know
who I am, do you?

00:20:44.737 --> 00:20:46.272
Not yet.

00:20:46.306 --> 00:20:48.707
I'm Kat Moody.

00:20:48.742 --> 00:20:50.443
You killed my husband.

00:20:50.477 --> 00:20:53.479
And now you're
sitting here eating food

00:20:53.513 --> 00:20:56.616
prepared for his wake,
food that I paid for.

00:20:59.053 --> 00:21:02.289
Well, I apologize
about the food.

00:21:02.323 --> 00:21:05.058
That was in bad taste.

00:21:05.093 --> 00:21:07.895
But not for killing my husband?

00:21:11.468 --> 00:21:14.070
He smashed me
in the head with a pipe

00:21:14.104 --> 00:21:16.138
and then fired a gun
at a crowded party.

00:21:16.173 --> 00:21:19.508
So, while I am sorry
for your grief...

00:21:22.579 --> 00:21:25.514
He laid a good one on you.

00:21:25.581 --> 00:21:27.382
He did.

00:21:31.921 --> 00:21:34.155
You're the second
woman to hit me today.

00:21:34.189 --> 00:21:35.958
I bet that's
a slow day for you.

00:21:35.992 --> 00:21:38.360
Mmm.

00:21:38.394 --> 00:21:41.563
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>
<i>Marcus, Dex, put those away.</i>

00:21:41.598 --> 00:21:43.532
Shut up, Kat, and get inside.

00:21:43.566 --> 00:21:47.336
You Moody boys sure do
like your six-shooters.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.404
You got permits for those?

00:21:49.439 --> 00:21:51.240
You won't be around
long enough to find out.

00:21:51.274 --> 00:21:53.108
You're not gonna shoot a man
at your brother's wake.

00:21:53.143 --> 00:21:54.576
What the hell
is wrong with you?

00:21:54.611 --> 00:21:56.378
We're doing this for Cole.

00:21:56.412 --> 00:21:58.648
Cole was a mean drunk
and he got what was coming.

00:21:58.682 --> 00:22:00.717
You watch your mouth, bitch.
I'll kill you, too.

00:22:00.751 --> 00:22:03.553
Hey, you're Marcus, right?
And you're Dex?

00:22:03.587 --> 00:22:05.088
That's right.

00:22:05.122 --> 00:22:07.857
Okay, Marcus, Dex,

00:22:07.892 --> 00:22:10.760
- you have the right to remain silent.
- That's far enough.

00:22:10.795 --> 00:22:13.363
Anything you do say can be used
against you in a court of law.

00:22:13.397 --> 00:22:15.799
- You believe the balls on this guy?
- He thinks he's arresting us.

00:22:15.833 --> 00:22:18.034
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Shut the fuck up.

00:22:18.069 --> 00:22:20.070
Why don't you make me?

00:22:21.005 --> 00:22:23.007
Come on.

00:22:26.545 --> 00:22:28.879
Marcus, Dex,

00:22:28.914 --> 00:22:31.048
your coffee is getting cold.

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:33.351
This don't concern you, Sugar.

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:36.120
All the same, I am concerned.

00:22:36.155 --> 00:22:38.823
Come on.

00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:45.863
Hmm?

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:51.503
If you can't afford
an attorney,

00:22:51.537 --> 00:22:54.672
the court will appoint one for
you, and he'll probably suck.

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:57.541
Sheriff Hood, they're drunk
and they're morons,

00:22:57.576 --> 00:22:59.843
but they're grieving
in their own way.

00:23:07.085 --> 00:23:09.920
Get the fuck out of here.

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:13.424
Go on.

00:23:15.561 --> 00:23:18.529
This isn't over, Hood.
We'll be looking out for you.

00:23:18.564 --> 00:23:21.066
Well, I'll be the one in the
car with the flashing lights.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.042
What the fuck
are you looking at?

00:23:37.852 --> 00:23:39.452
And you are?

00:25:42.552 --> 00:25:44.152
Let's go.

00:25:45.854 --> 00:25:48.690
Hey, stick to the trees for at
least two miles. You'll be fine.

00:25:48.724 --> 00:25:50.158
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

00:25:50.192 --> 00:25:52.227
- I'm gonna throw them off.
- No, I'm not leaving you!

00:25:52.261 --> 00:25:53.795
Listen to me.
You were right about Rabbit.

00:25:53.829 --> 00:25:56.030
- He knew. He knew.
- Don't do this.

00:25:56.064 --> 00:25:58.267
Don't do this. Don't do this.
We can make it.

00:25:58.301 --> 00:25:59.935
Hey, hey! I'll catch up to you.

00:25:59.969 --> 00:26:02.237
I love you. I love you.

00:26:02.272 --> 00:26:04.573
Take the diamonds.

00:26:04.608 --> 00:26:06.909
I'll catch up to you.

00:26:06.943 --> 00:26:08.510
Go!

00:26:09.979 --> 00:26:11.413
<i>Right there!</i>

00:26:11.447 --> 00:26:13.715
<i>No! I got you!</i>

00:26:13.749 --> 00:26:15.350
- <i>Stay right where you are.</i>

00:26:15.351 --> 00:26:16.951
<i>Get down
on the ground right now.</i>

00:26:16.985 --> 00:26:19.988
Right there. Hands up. Don't do it...

00:26:20.022 --> 00:26:21.990
Come on.

00:26:22.024 --> 00:26:24.027
Copy. We got him.

00:26:29.567 --> 00:26:31.502
Baby!

00:26:35.708 --> 00:26:37.842
Hey.

00:26:39.779 --> 00:26:41.780
You okay, baby?

00:26:41.814 --> 00:26:43.949
Yeah.

00:26:48.856 --> 00:26:50.957
Just a bad dream.

00:27:04.906 --> 00:27:06.974
Is that the Moody report?

00:27:08.076 --> 00:27:09.544
Yeah.

00:27:09.578 --> 00:27:11.413
It's supposed to be.

00:27:14.284 --> 00:27:16.452
But if I had known
there was all this paperwork,

00:27:16.486 --> 00:27:18.287
I never would have shot him.

00:27:18.355 --> 00:27:21.189
Aw, come on, you must have had
to do this back in Oregon.

00:27:21.224 --> 00:27:24.192
Uh, yeah, I wasn't
any better at it then.

00:27:25.461 --> 00:27:27.963
You filled out
the incident report twice.

00:27:27.997 --> 00:27:30.198
And you have to attach it
to the SO sheet.

00:27:31.334 --> 00:27:34.970
- SO?
- State oversight.

00:27:35.005 --> 00:27:38.841
Have you already done
the weapons discharge form?

00:27:46.582 --> 00:27:48.784
Uh, you know,

00:27:48.818 --> 00:27:52.588
Sheriff Morgan used to have
Alma do all this stuff for him.

00:27:52.622 --> 00:27:55.324
She enjoys it. Just buy her
a nice bottle of wine.

00:27:55.358 --> 00:27:58.059
Look it over when she's done.

00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:01.163
Sold.

00:28:07.237 --> 00:28:09.638
You gave us your word that
you'd stop ditching school.

00:28:09.672 --> 00:28:11.707
- My grades are fine.
- That is not the point.

00:28:11.741 --> 00:28:13.642
<i>So where were
you this afternoon?</i>

00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:15.877
What's the difference?
It's Saturday.

00:28:15.912 --> 00:28:18.780
- My grades are fine, too.
- Rock on, Max.

00:28:18.814 --> 00:28:22.318
Deva, this isn't a joke. Your
mother and I are worried about you.

00:28:22.352 --> 00:28:24.086
Well, there's nothing
to be worried about.

00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:26.923
- Okay?
- That's not what it looks like.

00:28:26.957 --> 00:28:28.991
What...

00:28:29.026 --> 00:28:30.626
Well, that went well.

00:28:30.661 --> 00:28:33.696
I just... I can't do this right now.

00:28:35.732 --> 00:28:38.901
Hey, we are not finished.

00:28:39.803 --> 00:28:41.203
Women, right?

00:28:41.238 --> 00:28:43.672
You little...

00:28:45.575 --> 00:28:47.411
- Dad...

00:28:47.412 --> 00:28:49.246
- If you turn into a
teenager, I will kill you.

00:29:19.414 --> 00:29:21.515
- Mr. Bowman.
- Deputy Brock.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.217
What can we do for you?

00:29:23.251 --> 00:29:25.853
- You are the new sheriff?
- That's right.

00:29:25.887 --> 00:29:28.656
Something is happening
at the Yoder farm tonight.

00:29:28.691 --> 00:29:30.324
Some kind of a barn party.

00:29:30.359 --> 00:29:32.460
- A rave?
- Yes.

00:29:32.494 --> 00:29:35.231
My son used that word.
He saw them setting it up.

00:29:35.265 --> 00:29:37.833
A rave in this town?

00:29:37.867 --> 00:29:40.069
Emmett.

00:29:40.103 --> 00:29:42.939
Yeah, thank you for coming in.

00:29:47.578 --> 00:29:52.182
Sheriff, you'll keep my
family's name out of this?

00:29:52.217 --> 00:29:54.218
Yeah, you were never here.

00:29:54.252 --> 00:29:56.520
Thank you.

00:29:56.554 --> 00:29:59.824
My daughter Rebecca.

00:30:08.367 --> 00:30:11.103
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Sheriff Hood.

00:30:11.137 --> 00:30:12.772
Very nice to meet you.

00:30:14.341 --> 00:30:16.008
You, too.

00:30:16.042 --> 00:30:19.111
<i>Rebecca, get in.</i>

00:30:36.598 --> 00:30:38.966
What's going on?

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.467
<i>Are we going to war?</i>

00:30:40.501 --> 00:30:42.770
These raves are highly
organized enterprises.

00:30:42.804 --> 00:30:46.006
It's designed for the sole
purpose of selling drugs.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.277
And where there are drugs,
there will be guns.

00:30:49.311 --> 00:30:51.379
Usually by the time
we hear about it,

00:30:51.413 --> 00:30:53.581
the place is trashed
and everyone is long gone.

00:30:53.615 --> 00:30:55.916
Let's go.

00:30:55.951 --> 00:30:57.585
Right?

00:30:59.187 --> 00:31:00.788
Right.

00:31:02.991 --> 00:31:06.160
Like, oh, my God.
There's so many people.

00:31:06.194 --> 00:31:08.162
We're with Hanson.
Beaty and Deva.

00:31:08.196 --> 00:31:10.365
<i>Oh, like that's gonna help?</i>

00:31:10.399 --> 00:31:14.235
- <i>Why don't you wait like everybody else?</i>
- VIPs? Nice.

00:31:23.645 --> 00:31:24.912
Hey, Hanson!

00:31:24.946 --> 00:31:26.646
Yeah, police band all quiet?

00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:28.815
Okay, people, let's get paid.

00:32:07.724 --> 00:32:10.527
- Hey!
- You made it. Hey.

00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:12.929
What's up? Oh, my God.

00:32:12.963 --> 00:32:15.898
- Snacks, anyone?
- Oh, Skulls!

00:32:15.933 --> 00:32:18.568
- What is it?
- It's E.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.127
Whoo!

00:32:52.572 --> 00:32:54.439
Hey, baby.

00:32:54.474 --> 00:32:56.308
You okay?

00:32:56.342 --> 00:32:58.443
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:33:11.058 --> 00:33:12.658
Deva.

00:33:14.461 --> 00:33:16.195
Deva.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:19.065
Deva!

00:33:21.736 --> 00:33:24.204
Deva.

00:33:31.813 --> 00:33:35.349
<i>♪ Psychotic, it's psychotic,</i>
<i>psychotic, it's psychotic ♪</i>

00:33:35.384 --> 00:33:39.287
<i>♪ Psychotic, it's psychotic,

00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:42.890

00:33:42.924 --> 00:33:46.359
<i>♪ Psychotic, psychotic,</i>
<i>psychotic... ♪</i>

00:34:06.848 --> 00:34:08.248
So what's the plan?

00:34:08.283 --> 00:34:11.284
All right, there's only two
ways in and out of here...

00:34:11.319 --> 00:34:14.721
that front entrance and then there's
a utility door around back.

00:34:14.755 --> 00:34:16.723
Should be pretty easy
for us to cover.

00:34:16.757 --> 00:34:19.759
Yeah, but God only knows how
many kids are actually in there.

00:34:19.794 --> 00:34:21.327
Start a panic,

00:34:21.362 --> 00:34:24.031
this thing could go
from bad to worse fast.

00:34:24.065 --> 00:34:25.533
What are you doing?

00:34:25.567 --> 00:34:27.601
We need to see inside.

00:34:27.636 --> 00:34:29.570
If I can find
the guy in charge,

00:34:29.604 --> 00:34:32.873
we can shut this down
without starting a riot.

00:34:32.907 --> 00:34:36.243
So you're just gonna wander in
there and ask who's in charge?

00:34:36.277 --> 00:34:38.378
- That's your plan?
- Yeah.

00:34:38.413 --> 00:34:40.847
Oh, great.

00:34:40.882 --> 00:34:43.483
Aren't you kind of old
to pass for a teenager?

00:34:43.517 --> 00:34:44.951
I'm young at heart.

00:34:44.985 --> 00:34:46.620
Can't be out of uniform, Hood.

00:34:46.655 --> 00:34:48.255
You are legally required
to identify yourself.

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:49.991
Is he always this much fun?

00:35:02.872 --> 00:35:04.572
Yeah, I'm here for the rave.

00:35:04.607 --> 00:35:07.508
- There's no rave here.
- Come on, guys, what's it gonna take?

00:35:12.849 --> 00:35:15.417
Shit. Are you kidding me?

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:19.921
He can't... he can't
just do that, right?

00:35:25.595 --> 00:35:29.032
- He's waving.
- Yeah.

00:35:29.066 --> 00:35:31.000
What do we do?

00:35:39.044 --> 00:35:41.279
<i>Moore,
what's your count on the gate?</i>

00:35:56.129 --> 00:36:00.033
<i>Moore, are you hearing me?</i>
<i>I asked what's your count.</i>

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:04.004
<i>Moore, what the fuck? Respond.</i>

00:36:06.508 --> 00:36:08.776
<i>Someone get me eyes on Moore.</i>

00:36:18.755 --> 00:36:20.923
Someone get me eyes on Moore.

00:36:20.958 --> 00:36:22.526
You got nothing?

00:36:34.071 --> 00:36:36.038
<i>Hey, it's Deva.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

00:36:36.073 --> 00:36:38.607
<i>Or don't.</i>

00:37:04.903 --> 00:37:06.504
Reed? Reed.

00:37:06.538 --> 00:37:08.940
What is it?

00:37:09.007 --> 00:37:11.109
Reed! Reed!

00:37:16.048 --> 00:37:19.717
Help! Somebody help me!

00:37:27.525 --> 00:37:29.026
Reed!

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.093
Somebody...

00:37:30.128 --> 00:37:31.628
help!

00:37:31.663 --> 00:37:33.764
Please!

00:37:46.511 --> 00:37:48.512
<i>Help!</i>

00:37:52.717 --> 00:37:55.118
Something's wrong. Call the
paramedics and get in here.

00:37:55.153 --> 00:37:57.087
We've got to shut
this down fast.

00:38:03.129 --> 00:38:05.998
Everyone clear out.
It's going south.

00:38:07.967 --> 00:38:09.869
Five-O, move out now!

00:38:11.771 --> 00:38:16.042
Somebody help! Help!

00:38:20.014 --> 00:38:22.049
<i>Help!</i>

00:38:23.218 --> 00:38:25.752
- Somebody help me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

00:38:25.787 --> 00:38:28.655
Come on. Come on.

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.657
Move!

00:38:34.295 --> 00:38:36.797
Look at me. Look at me.
You okay?

00:38:36.831 --> 00:38:39.566
Are you okay?

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.135
<i>- Are you okay? Deva?</i>

00:38:44.772 --> 00:38:47.475
This is the BSD.

00:38:47.509 --> 00:38:50.010
Please start exiting
in an orderly fashion.

00:38:55.783 --> 00:38:58.585
You stay here. Do not move.

00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:00.353
Stay there.

00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:03.657
- Get out! Get out!
- Get out.

00:39:46.671 --> 00:39:48.639
Hey!

00:40:29.015 --> 00:40:31.717
<i>You good?</i>

00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:33.853
I'm good.

00:40:37.157 --> 00:40:39.091
- Is it charged?
- Charged.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.160
- Anything?
- No.

00:40:42.195 --> 00:40:44.196
<i>All right. Ready? Charge.</i>

00:40:47.601 --> 00:40:49.969
- No.
- <i>All right, we gotta call it.</i>

00:40:50.004 --> 00:40:51.571
No. No!

00:40:51.639 --> 00:40:55.108
No! Oh, no!

00:40:55.176 --> 00:40:58.311
Reed! No!

00:40:58.345 --> 00:41:01.481
- Oh, my God!
- Shh. It's okay.

00:41:01.515 --> 00:41:03.650
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

00:41:03.684 --> 00:41:06.820
Shh.

00:41:20.804 --> 00:41:23.439
Sit tight. Turn around.

00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:28.344
Look at this. Reed Schumacher.

00:41:28.378 --> 00:41:31.814
State Senator Schumacher,
that's his son.

00:41:35.988 --> 00:41:38.189
What the fuck are you
looking at, bitch?

00:41:38.257 --> 00:41:40.724
Hey, shut your mouth.

00:41:46.531 --> 00:41:49.266
I asked you a question, bitch...
what the fuck are you looking at?

00:41:50.235 --> 00:41:52.870
Sheriff! Sheriff! Hood!

00:41:52.904 --> 00:41:54.772
Get the fuck off me.

00:41:58.677 --> 00:42:00.244
Come on, I'll take
you both home.

00:42:14.194 --> 00:42:15.828
Hood, hey,
what the fuck was that?

00:42:15.862 --> 00:42:17.330
Hey, leave it, Brock.

00:42:17.364 --> 00:42:19.131
You just beat the shit
out of a handcuffed perp

00:42:19.166 --> 00:42:21.101
- in front of 10 witnesses.
- He had it coming.

00:42:21.202 --> 00:42:22.837
I don't know how
you did things out West,

00:42:22.871 --> 00:42:26.006
but you cannot keep making up
the rules as you go along here.

00:42:26.041 --> 00:42:29.110
All right? You're putting the rest
of us in an impossible position.

00:42:30.579 --> 00:42:31.946
Get in.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:33.881
And what the hell
am I supposed to do, huh?

00:42:33.916 --> 00:42:36.284
You know what?

00:42:36.318 --> 00:42:38.453
I'd seriously
consider resigning.

00:42:38.487 --> 00:42:40.388
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:42:40.423 --> 00:42:42.457
You know what, Sheriff?

00:42:42.492 --> 00:42:43.760
I was here long
before you and I'm

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:45.027
gonna be here long
after you're gone,

00:42:45.061 --> 00:42:47.364
which by the looks of it,
is gonna be pretty damn soon.

00:42:47.399 --> 00:42:49.066
- Maybe.
- Mm-hmm.

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.202
But right now

00:42:51.236 --> 00:42:53.538
the smartest career move
you could make

00:42:53.572 --> 00:42:56.574
would be to get
the fuck out of my way.

00:43:33.748 --> 00:43:36.050
Wait!

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:44.024
What...

00:43:44.058 --> 00:43:47.694
You cut my fucking finger off.

00:43:47.762 --> 00:43:49.613
Our ecstasy trade
generates revenues of

00:43:49.614 --> 00:43:51.464
a quarter of a million
dollars a week

00:43:51.499 --> 00:43:53.600
in Philadelphia and DC.

00:43:53.634 --> 00:43:55.602
I spent years and serious money

00:43:55.636 --> 00:43:57.037
developing that network.

00:43:57.071 --> 00:43:59.039
And because I'm not
a fucking idiot,

00:43:59.074 --> 00:44:01.609
I never sold a single pill
in this county.

00:44:01.643 --> 00:44:04.111
I don't shit where
I sleep, Mr. Hanson.

00:44:04.145 --> 00:44:06.613
You, on the other hand, have
just taken a steaming dump

00:44:06.647 --> 00:44:08.282
right in the middle
of my fucking bed.

00:44:08.316 --> 00:44:09.783
You stole my Skulls,

00:44:09.851 --> 00:44:12.018
you cooked up a tainted
batch that killed a boy.

00:44:12.053 --> 00:44:13.620
But not just any boy.

00:44:13.654 --> 00:44:17.224
The boy of a state senator.
Do you understand?

00:44:17.292 --> 00:44:19.059
You've unleashed
a shitstorm on me.

00:44:19.093 --> 00:44:21.127
I'm sorry, Mr. Proctor.

00:44:24.499 --> 00:44:27.434
Now...

00:44:27.469 --> 00:44:30.538
I want you to look
over here at Preacher.

00:44:30.572 --> 00:44:33.040
Preacher now has
a taste for you.

00:44:34.743 --> 00:44:37.044
I'll give you 60 seconds.

00:44:39.348 --> 00:44:42.784
What? Are you fucking serious?

00:44:42.818 --> 00:44:44.919
Starting now.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.928
<i>Fass!</i>

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.275
<i>Please!</i>

00:45:53.094 --> 00:45:55.762
It's a hard thing
to see someone die.

00:46:03.005 --> 00:46:07.208
First time,
I was younger than you.

00:46:08.911 --> 00:46:11.779
A kid from my neighborhood

00:46:11.847 --> 00:46:13.781
tried to run across
the railroad tracks.

00:46:15.216 --> 00:46:20.053
He tripped on
some gravel and...

00:46:20.121 --> 00:46:22.990
you know.

00:46:27.529 --> 00:46:30.197
Thing is,

00:46:30.231 --> 00:46:33.066
you can't make sense out of it.

00:46:33.101 --> 00:46:35.202
All right?

00:46:36.705 --> 00:46:39.206
It doesn't make sense.

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:43.877
You hear me?

00:46:46.181 --> 00:46:48.216
You just...

00:46:50.885 --> 00:46:53.287
I don't know.

00:46:53.321 --> 00:46:56.423
You accept it at some point.

00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:09.136
Was he a friend of yours?

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:11.272
The kid on the tracks?

00:47:14.209 --> 00:47:16.144
No.

00:47:18.547 --> 00:47:21.516
No, he was just some asshole
from the neighborhood.

00:47:23.286 --> 00:47:26.788
And I was another asshole who dared
him to beat the 5:15 Amtrak.

00:47:31.026 --> 00:47:33.828
Now you listen to me. Hey.

00:47:38.135 --> 00:47:40.536
