00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:30.572
Four, four.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:44.044
Okay. Everyone remember the rules?

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.340
Are you sure this is the best idea?

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:51.593
What else are we gonna do?

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:59.643
- Okay, have you got any eights?
- Uh...

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:01.603
Go fish.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.694
Hey, it's your turn.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.241
Uh, um...

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:18.786
Go fish.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.755
The<i> Resolute</i> made 23 routine trips.
So what happened to ours?

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.551
There's no use in speculating.

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:35.596
<i>Completing de-orbit burn.</i>

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:36.680
Helmets on.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.730
<i>Begin entry phase in 30 seconds.</i>

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:54.156
Okay. Um, it's still my turn.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.164
Do you have any nines?

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.583
- Seriously, Penny?
- What?

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:05.917
Did you see my hand?

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:07.210
You count cards.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:08.670
I don't know why everyone doesn't.

00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:10.589
Okay, can I have my nine, please?

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.016
<i>Music off.</i>
<i>Atmospheric disturbance detected.</i>

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.809
Deep breaths.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.270
Remember your training.

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:29.900
The computer will land us just fine.
That's what it's for.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.401
Deep breaths.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.095
<i>Impact detected.</i>

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.055
<i>Landing trajectory off course.</i>

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.518
- Mom!
- Take my hand.

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:07.051
It's okay.

00:03:07.076 --> 00:03:08.143
- Hold on to me!
<i>- Warning.</i>

00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:10.026
<i>Entry angle exceeding parameters.</i>

00:03:10.144 --> 00:03:11.596
<i>Correcting.</i>

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:13.527
<i>- 4,000 feet.</i>
- It's okay.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.488
<i>3,000 feet.</i>

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.824
<i>Entry angle exceeding parameters.</i>

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.909
- Take my hand.
<i>- 2,000 feet.</i>

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:22.160
Take my hand.

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:26.248
<i>1,000 feet. Brace for impact.
Brace for impact. Brace for impact.</i>

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.514
Sound off.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.641
Judy accounted for.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.476
Penny accounted for.

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:52.607
Will? Will? Are you all right?

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:53.691
Accounted for.

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:56.319
<i>Landing surface unstable.</i>

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:57.529
Let's evacuate.

00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:59.531
- Supply cabinet.
- Already on it.

00:04:01.598 --> 00:04:02.659
Maureen?

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:05.078
- It's my leg.
- Mom?

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:06.830
It's fine. It's just stuck.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.459
It's okay. I got this.
You go get the supplies.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:11.543
Will, follow me.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:12.794
Damn it!

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.550
- Will, stay close.
- I'm coming.

00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:22.637
Quick, to the top hatch. Come on.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.432
In here. Come on.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.821
- It's jammed! Will, come on up.
- Okay.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:43.074
<i>Landing surface unstable.</i>

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:47.329
- Judy. Come on.
- I'm up!

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:55.837
I don't fit.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.964
We'll have to go around.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.052
Don't go anywhere. We'll come around.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.723
Wow.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:10.537
Are those other Jupiters?

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:12.539
At least eight.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.791
We're not the only ones that made it.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.378
Made it where?

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.255
Here, sit down.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.094
Lucky I just happened to be here.

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:27.887
Lucky thing.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:32.516
No, no, no!

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.005
<i>So, who's my Secret Santa?</i>

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:12.432
- Ta-da!
<i>- Are those my mom's cookies?</i>

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:15.810
Grandma wasn't here to bake them
this year, so, gave it a shot.

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:17.979
<i>She never trusted me with the recipe.</i>

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:19.773
I don't know, I guess I'm just special?

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.735
So, where are you these days?

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:25.987
You know he can't say.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:29.783
Well, wherever you are, it's night,

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.701
which rules out Europe,

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.537
Africa, the Middle East,

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.957
Asia, Australia...

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.458
Is that our hedge?

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:43.797
What?

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:45.799
<i>You guys are too smart.</i>

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:50.220
Dad!

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.682
Dad! I missed you.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:56.309
- You're home.
- Oh, my God!

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:57.477
Let me in.

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:03.692
- Ew, you guys.
- Gross. Get a room.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:06.861
What did you bring me?

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:12.659
You know how many strings
I had to pull to get here?

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.293
Hello?

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:24.837
What?

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:26.922
When?

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:30.468
<i>Astronomers at
the Near-Earth Object office</i>

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:33.479
<i>discovered a sizable,
unknown celestial object</i>

00:08:33.504 --> 00:08:34.656
<i>that's headed our way.</i>

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:37.100
<i>NASA scientists are working
around the clock</i>

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.003
<i>to track the object's orbital path</i>

00:08:39.028 --> 00:08:40.335
<i>and to assess the risk of collision.</i>

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:41.395
I have it.

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:42.981
<i>A news briefing has been scheduled...</i>

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:45.692
I'm gonna take a look, okay, Mom?

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.235
Mmm-hmm.

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.029
It's broken.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.781
Well, that's too bad.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.747
Hey, you took time to grab that?
Who were you planning to call?

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.082
I grabbed a pack.
I did what I was supposed to do.

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.959
Hey, kids, it could be worse.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.335
How?

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.131
Mom, no!

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:11.009
Hey, what are you doing?
We haven't tested the atmosphere.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.304
You already did. Look.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.932
If the air was toxic,
you'd be dead by now.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:29.319
Not a bad consolation prize.

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:31.654
First fresh air in months.

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:49.798
Mayday, mayday. This is <i>Jupiter 2.</i>
Do you read? Over.

00:09:55.126 --> 00:09:56.907
Probably should have
read the fine print

00:09:56.932 --> 00:09:58.945
before I launched into space.

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:01.851
<i>Okay. Let's figure out where we are.</i>

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:05.105
We evacuated the<i> Resolute</i> halfway
between home and the colony...

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:07.732
Just call it Earth.
It's not your home anymore.

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:11.736
Earth and the colony.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.322
This planet is unlike any
we have ever mapped.

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:17.325
Wherever we are, I...
It's a Goldilocks planet.

00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:20.203
Earth-like atmosphere,
air-pressure, gravity.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.914
Clearly no lack of water. It's...

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.583
The odds of that happening are...

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.128
It's like winning the lottery.

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:30.964
The way not dying in a car accident
is like winning the lottery.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.091
Until you remember
you were in a car accident.

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.135
We're lost.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.219
No kidding.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.433
I can't raise any of the other Jupiters.

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:46.312
The <i>Resolute</i> will send
a rescue party, right?

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:48.773
I'm sure they'll follow
emergency protocol.

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.984
Hey, where does it hurt?

00:10:51.097 --> 00:10:52.724
All across here.

00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:54.813
It's from the crash harness.
It's normal.

00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:56.322
To you, maybe. Not to him.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:57.740
He didn't mean anything by it.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:00.076
Yeah, maybe he just forgot
we're not under his command.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.703
It's okay.

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:05.790
You're all right. Inhale.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:07.500
Hold.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.094
Is that another crashed ship?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.388
You're disappointing me.
Look at the color.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:22.348
It's bright white...

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.017
If it was rocket fuel,
it would be reddish.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.100
Right.

00:11:25.834 --> 00:11:26.927
Okay, hint.

00:11:26.988 --> 00:11:29.115
It's not a chemistry question,
it's a geology question.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.403
Once that water freezes,

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:38.489
the Jupiter's gonna be locked
in 50 feet of solid ice.

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.326
- How long do we have?
- A while.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.494
- How long's "a while"?
- It depends.

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:47.040
On hull thermodynamics, water salinity,

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:50.251
how much displacement there is...
It's complicated. Does it matter?

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.837
You tell me. I know you've already
done the calculations.

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:56.758
We should talk about this privately.

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.801
You two mind letting us in on this?

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:09.020
In six hours, the sun's gonna go down,

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:13.524
and indications are, it will drop
to 60 degrees below zero,

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.568
at which point, our
power cells will die...

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:16.694
And so will we.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.405
We can't go anywhere
because of your leg.

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.824
- I'm still figuring it out.
- What if you can't?

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:22.951
Then you leave me here.

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.495
You descend the glacier
and it'll be warmer down there.

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:26.579
- Mom, stop!
- No, Mom!

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:27.872
There's another way.

00:12:30.746 --> 00:12:31.787
We go back down,

00:12:31.812 --> 00:12:33.925
get one of the big ion lithiums
to recharge the suits.

00:12:33.966 --> 00:12:35.293
Not with that tear in your suit.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.715
Airlock's too far,
you'll be dead in minutes.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.092
The broken top hatch.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.136
It's closer.

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.142
- It'll only be a quick trip in and out.
- No.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.352
He's the only one who'll fit.

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:50.645
No. Absolutely not.

00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:52.772
He did the same training,
passed the same tests.

00:12:52.797 --> 00:12:54.035
You can't train for this.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.699
Actually, you can. And he did.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.861
- Will, come with me.
- John?

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.405
- Come on.
- John!

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.241
Okay. You gotta listen to me.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:06.452
All you have to do is go back in
the same way you came out.

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:10.039
Supply room's right there. It's easy.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:13.251
Okay? Take your jacket off.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:18.297
Okay. Hey, hey, buddy.

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:20.383
It's no different
from the EVA tank training

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.635
you did back home. Okay?

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.220
I'm gonna get the suit.

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:34.814
Okay, here we go. Let's
put this back on.

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.861
- I got this, squirt.
- Judy!

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.165
Judy, get back up here right now.

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.336
<i>You know you won't
fit through the top hatch.</i>

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:00.798
The top hatch isn't
the only way in, Dad.

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:04.010
The supply room is too far
from the aft airlock.

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:05.386
<i>It's too risky.</i>

00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:08.806
You take risks for a living, Dad.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.642
<i>No, I take orders.
And I'm giving you one right now.</i>

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:13.936
<i>I'm already in.</i>

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:20.485
Listen to me. She's gonna be okay. Okay?

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:23.863
She's always okay.
It's actually really annoying.

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:39.921
The bulkhead's jammed.
I can't get through.

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:42.423
Okay. Well, that settles it.
Get back up here right now.

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:50.431
I can make it.

00:14:59.141 --> 00:15:00.215
Damn it.

00:15:00.272 --> 00:15:02.357
Honey, I don't know
when the water's gonna freeze.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:05.821
I'm fine.

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.799
Hey, Judy?

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.802
<i>Judy, why can't we see you by now?</i>

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:33.099
<i>- Judy?</i>
- I took a Chariot battery.

00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:35.768
You're down in the garage?

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:38.563
<i>Get out of there right now.</i>

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:40.647
Yeah, good idea.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:44.986
Judy, hurry up.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:49.073
Faster. Move.

00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:52.492
Hurry!

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:55.829
Come on, Judy.

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:01.334
Drop the battery.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:02.670
<i>Drop the battery!</i>

00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:12.345
Take my hand.

00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:21.105
Damn it!

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:28.488
<i>I can't move!</i>
<i>Get me out of here! Get me out!</i>

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.406
<i>Get me out! Get me out!</i>

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.451
Okay. Okay. Okay, listen.

00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:36.120
Control your breathing.

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:42.585
- Penny, get the computer.
- Okay.

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:44.921
It's gonna be okay.

00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:49.217
Your suit will keep you warm. And...

00:16:51.212 --> 00:16:53.606
you've got at least
five hours of oxygen.

00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:54.683
Okay.

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:57.416
<i>So just don't talk any more
than you have to, okay?</i>

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.447
Hey... you're in worse shape
than you look.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.991
Is that a compliment?

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:15.660
You need to get some rest.

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:17.411
I need to help my baby girl.

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:19.622
We will. We will.

00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:29.340
No more doing anything until I say so.

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:35.680
Maureen.

00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:38.348
Maureen.

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.646
- Is she okay?
- Dad?

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:46.649
It's okay. It's okay.
She's just resting.

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:51.237
Okay. It's okay.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:53.572
Judy...

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.577
<i>- Judy, I just want to say...</i>
- Don't talk to me, please.

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:19.640
You're almost to me, right?

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.647
Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm getting there.

00:18:54.842 --> 00:18:55.843
What is it?

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:59.805
The white fire. I
figured out what it is.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:01.390
I don't have time for this.

00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:05.866
I mean, when we crashed,

00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:07.819
we must have scraped
open a pure vein of it.

00:19:07.844 --> 00:19:09.388
Vein of what?

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:11.692
Magnesium.

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:17.490
Magnesium burns hot.
But you know what makes it burn hotter?

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:21.910
Ice.

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.626
Judy, I gotta go get something.

00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:30.628
- You're leaving?
- <i>It'll help get you out.</i>

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.962
I'll be back.

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.172
Gonna have to hold down the fort.

00:19:46.197 --> 00:19:47.953
It's actually more of a tent, but...

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:51.147
You'll be fine.
Just radio me if anything goes wrong.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.236
Will, you coming?

00:19:56.478 --> 00:19:57.538
Me?

00:19:57.583 --> 00:20:01.128
Yeah, it's your idea.
And I don't know what I'm looking for.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:02.701
Come on.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:08.708
I'll see you later, okay?

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:01.677
Hi. Can I look at this one, please?
Thank you.

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:08.350
It looks really expensive.

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:10.269
Mom, it's babysitting money.

00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:12.354
It's like being paid to study.

00:21:12.431 --> 00:21:14.065
I know we're not doing Secret Santa,

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.266
but I wanna get a gift for Dad,

00:21:15.298 --> 00:21:16.299
in case he shows up.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.112
He's done it before.

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.823
I just don't want you
to be disappointed again.

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:25.534
Well, it's a good thing
I got thick skin.

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:29.538
You shouldn't have to have thick skin.

00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:33.125
He's been in the worst of it
for two years.

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.377
Mom, he's made sacrifices. So should we.

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:38.047
- Okay.
- Can I take that, please?

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.299
Oh, here. I'll put it on the card.

00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:42.885
Just for the points.
You can pay me when I get the bill.

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:43.969
Sure, okay.

00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:48.682
How easy is it to return this?

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:51.852
It's fine, as long as
it hasn't been worn.

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:53.854
Yeah. It won't be.

00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:57.525
Hey, Mom, I'm gonna go
find a present for Judy.

00:21:57.608 --> 00:21:59.161
She told me to give it to charity,

00:21:59.186 --> 00:22:01.219
but she's just trying
to make me look bad.

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:13.040
How's Mom?

00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:15.501
I thought you weren't
supposed to be talking.

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:17.711
Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

00:22:21.215 --> 00:22:23.008
Seriously, how is she?

00:22:23.843 --> 00:22:26.512
<i>She's... She's still out. Uh...</i>

00:22:27.096 --> 00:22:30.057
Breathing and her heart rate is normal.

00:22:32.935 --> 00:22:34.019
Keep talking.

00:22:34.961 --> 00:22:36.468
Pretty high up on the list of things

00:22:36.493 --> 00:22:37.831
I never thought I'd hear you say.

00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:40.276
You must have some books
loaded on your phone.

00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:42.862
<i>Do you have anything good?</i>

00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:48.951
I, in fact, happen to have
some of the best books ever written.

00:22:49.326 --> 00:22:53.372
<i>Complete Dickens,
complete Shakespeare...</i>

00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:57.668
Do you have anything... trashy?

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:01.380
Why would I bring something trashy
to the new world?

00:23:01.569 --> 00:23:03.090
"We're here to establish a colony

00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:05.556
to expand the bounds
of human experience."

00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:06.801
Hmm.

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:10.139
Well, they say everyone should read
<i>Moby-Dick</i> before they die.

00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:18.147
- Don't say that.
- Well, do you have it?

00:23:19.982 --> 00:23:21.525
Of course I have it.

00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:23.360
<i>Well, is it any good?</i>

00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:29.533
I don't know.

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:33.037
Um... I haven't gotten to the M's yet.

00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:36.749
Well, proceed.

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:48.385
"Call me Ishmael."

00:23:48.469 --> 00:23:50.804
Okay, "Ishmael," if you insist.

00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:53.974
Okay, first of all,
that wasn't even remotely funny.

00:23:54.058 --> 00:23:59.438
And, secondly, you're supposed to be
conserving oxygen. So, quiet.

00:24:01.732 --> 00:24:03.067
<i>"Call me Ishmael."</i>

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:08.405
<i>"Some years ago,
never mind how long precisely..."</i>

00:24:18.499 --> 00:24:21.794
Just follow my lead.
Not sure how stable this glacier is.

00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:24.630
Don't wanna fall down a crevasse.

00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:26.465
Wait, that could happen?

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.510
Just follow my lead.

00:24:33.263 --> 00:24:34.515
So, uh...

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:37.685
So what are you into nowadays?

00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:39.979
I mean, besides magnesium.

00:24:40.062 --> 00:24:41.828
I'm not.

00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:44.966
I just ended up testing
into the geology program.

00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:46.318
Yeah, well, they do that.

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:49.488
You're good at something,
they make you do it.

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:54.368
I remember you used to like baseball.

00:24:55.744 --> 00:24:56.744
Yeah.

00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:01.208
Yeah, I used to.

00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:02.667
Models?

00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:05.170
Does anyone make models anymore?

00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:08.006
I like to read.

00:25:10.384 --> 00:25:12.037
I don't think I've read anything except

00:25:12.062 --> 00:25:15.788
instruction manuals for... years.

00:25:24.898 --> 00:25:26.025
Oh, damn.

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:31.488
Yes. That... That's a lot of magnesium.

00:25:31.572 --> 00:25:32.698
Well...

00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:36.994
What do you say we go get some
that isn't burning?

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:39.036
Come on.

00:25:52.544 --> 00:25:54.751
<i>"Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats,</i>

00:25:54.776 --> 00:25:56.030
<i>and with their heads</i>

00:25:56.096 --> 00:25:57.639
<i>- muffled in woolen... "</i>"
<i>- Penny!</i>

00:25:58.474 --> 00:26:04.104
What? Mom! Mom, easy.
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

00:26:04.264 --> 00:26:05.438
Where's Will?

00:26:05.463 --> 00:26:07.782
He went with Dad to get some magnesium.

00:26:08.275 --> 00:26:09.275
What?

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.529
Whose idea was that?

00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:15.530
Will's.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.038
What're we looking for?

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:24.041
It's that grayish stuff there.

00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:31.340
That's what it looks like
before it ignites.

00:26:31.924 --> 00:26:35.552
Hey, I'm, uh...
I'm not gonna blow us up, am I?

00:26:37.137 --> 00:26:38.597
Not unless you make a spark.

00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:41.808
Okay.

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:53.195
- How long have we been gone?
- Judy's got plenty of time.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.828
Hey, it happened.

00:27:02.162 --> 00:27:04.581
It happened because I froze up.

00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:07.960
You jumped through a lot of hoops
to get on this mission.

00:27:08.544 --> 00:27:11.213
You earned your spot
just like everyone else.

00:27:11.296 --> 00:27:12.881
I don't feel like everyone else.

00:27:21.098 --> 00:27:23.308
I think we've got enough to get her out.

00:27:23.392 --> 00:27:25.310
Now, let's get out of here
before it blows up.

00:27:29.606 --> 00:27:34.361
Will! Will! Will!

00:27:43.287 --> 00:27:46.832
Will, do you read me? Will!

00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:50.335
Here.

00:27:52.796 --> 00:27:55.549
Mom? Hey.

00:27:58.385 --> 00:28:00.137
It's getting worse, isn't it?

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.432
Feels like my leg is in a vice.

00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:08.312
Penny, I think we should take a look.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.274
- "We"?
- Does the skin feel hard or soft?

00:28:20.282 --> 00:28:22.451
Oh, yeah.

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:25.329
<i>Yeah, her leg is hard as a rock.</i>

00:28:25.454 --> 00:28:28.040
Okay. Mom, I think you have
compartment syndrome.

00:28:28.457 --> 00:28:31.460
<i>Edema from the fracture has created
too much pressure in your leg.</i>

00:28:31.485 --> 00:28:32.519
<i>We have to release it.</i>

00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:35.005
<i>Penny's gonna have to do
a little procedure, okay?</i>

00:28:35.088 --> 00:28:36.423
Uh, no, she's not.

00:28:36.506 --> 00:28:38.800
<i>- I'll talk her through it.</i>
- It's your call.

00:28:38.884 --> 00:28:41.386
Penny, there's a combo syringe
in the kit.

00:28:42.054 --> 00:28:44.067
<i>It's blue and white.
It'll knock her out.</i>

00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:56.193
It's okay? Okay. Okay. Yeah.

00:28:56.902 --> 00:28:59.071
- Is she out?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

00:28:59.154 --> 00:29:01.406
Okay. We have to do
a four-compartment fasciotomy.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.325
How hard is this procedure?

00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:05.981
I've heard it's pretty straightforward.

00:29:06.006 --> 00:29:07.965
You've <i>heard</i> it's pretty straight...

00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:10.415
You haven't done this before?

00:29:11.124 --> 00:29:14.253
Okay. Lay out the scalpel
and plenty of gauze, okay?

00:29:14.878 --> 00:29:19.675
Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Okay.

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:28.766
Okay.

00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:31.478
There are four spaces in the lower leg
containing muscle

00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:34.398
<i>- that are surrounded by fascia.</i>
- By what?

00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:37.067
You know that white stuff you see
when you eat steak?

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.278
<i>That's fascia. The red
stuff, it's muscle.</i>

00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:40.361
Okay.

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:43.198
It's just like steak.

00:29:43.949 --> 00:29:45.492
I like steak.

00:29:45.575 --> 00:29:48.578
This is not Mom, this is steak.

00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:51.038
Yeah.

00:29:51.081 --> 00:29:53.583
Find the bone that sticks out
under the kneecap.

00:29:54.251 --> 00:29:58.380
Move about two fingers away from it
down on either side,

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:00.340
<i>- and cut all the way down.</i>
- Okay.

00:30:00.716 --> 00:30:02.259
Cut all the way down to where?

00:30:02.342 --> 00:30:03.969
All the way down to her ankle.

00:30:07.014 --> 00:30:09.558
<i>Penny, you have to cut deep, okay?</i>

00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:13.312
Until you see the muscle. The steak.
Cut until you see the steak.

00:30:14.354 --> 00:30:19.109
The steak. Okay,
it's just a really juicy piece of steak.

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.570
I'm done! Done! I did it!

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:24.239
Great. Now you only have to do it
three times more.

00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:36.834
Dad?

00:30:38.253 --> 00:30:39.796
Dad, come in.

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:45.677
Dad! Dad!

00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:18.668
<i>Will, do you read me? Will.</i>

00:31:18.752 --> 00:31:20.879
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:24.549
Are you hurt?

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.300
No.

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:27.719
Thank God.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:30.555
<i>Can you get back up here?</i>

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:37.938
No. I don't think so.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.565
<i>Okay, where are you? What do you see?</i>

00:31:41.525 --> 00:31:42.609
<i>Are you safe?</i>

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.863
There's vegetation all over the place.

00:31:46.947 --> 00:31:49.866
<i>So there's bound to be things
that eat the vegetation...</i>

00:31:50.325 --> 00:31:53.495
and things that eat those things.

00:31:53.954 --> 00:31:56.790
Okay. Just... Just don't touch anything.

00:31:56.873 --> 00:32:00.419
Yeah. Just get down here soon. Okay?

00:32:00.502 --> 00:32:03.130
Of course I will. But I, uh...

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:08.135
It's gonna take some time.

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.471
<i>Time your sister doesn't have.</i>

00:32:11.555 --> 00:32:12.555
Wait.

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:15.058
<i>Wait, you're leaving?</i>

00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:18.728
I have to go help Judy first.

00:32:18.812 --> 00:32:22.232
And then I'm turning around
and coming straight back here.

00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:24.943
<i>I'll be back soon, I promise.</i>

00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:29.781
<i>You're going to be fine.</i>

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.159
<i>Will?</i>

00:32:34.828 --> 00:32:36.496
You got that? You're gonna be fine.

00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:42.751
Go save her.

00:32:46.006 --> 00:32:47.299
You have to.

00:32:55.474 --> 00:32:56.725
I'll be fine.

00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:11.406
It's crazy that they built this thing
for real.

00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:15.410
Someday we're gonna be on it.

00:33:16.369 --> 00:33:17.369
You are.

00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:21.833
Hey, the test results haven't
come in yet. Wait until they do.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.837
I froze up. And...

00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:30.425
the man giving the test made a face
when I stepped out of the tank.

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.678
He made a face at me, too.

00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:38.391
It's their job. To make faces.

00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:45.232
If I didn't pass, then...

00:33:48.818 --> 00:33:50.987
that means they're gonna
make me stay behind.

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:58.370
So, we need to get something clear.

00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:00.539
Look at me.

00:34:03.124 --> 00:34:08.463
There's a rule that's written in stone.
And it is never broken.

00:34:10.799 --> 00:34:13.218
The Robinsons stick together.

00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:23.687
What are you doing?

00:34:25.272 --> 00:34:27.482
I'll just borrow your manuals
when they come in.

00:34:32.862 --> 00:34:35.448
All right, let's do this.

00:34:36.992 --> 00:34:40.161
- Do I paint first or...
- Use this to trim the edges.

00:34:40.245 --> 00:34:41.663
To trim the edges.

00:35:00.307 --> 00:35:02.976
When you were little,
I always loved to watch you sleep.

00:35:03.893 --> 00:35:05.937
I don't think you should
be moving around.

00:35:07.022 --> 00:35:08.565
Well, it's excellent work.

00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:15.030
No, Judy did the hard part.
The studying and the exams...

00:35:18.825 --> 00:35:21.911
You're all that matters, you know.
You three.

00:35:23.997 --> 00:35:25.707
It's why we left.

00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:30.420
I wanted to find a home
that was worthy of you.

00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:37.427
We're gonna make it.

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:41.389
Of course we are.

00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:46.978
Every problem has a solution.

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:05.890
Hi, Will.

00:37:06.718 --> 00:37:08.645
So, tell your sisters

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.328
that we're going out for Mexican.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:16.693
Yeah, I heard colony tortillas
leave a funny aftertaste

00:37:16.776 --> 00:37:18.361
because of the hybrid corn.

00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:22.699
Yes.

00:37:24.576 --> 00:37:25.660
Yes.

00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:29.122
We're celebrating.

00:37:56.775 --> 00:38:00.320
This is Will Robinson of the <i>Jupiter 2.</i>
Over.

00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:03.615
Calling any survivors.

00:38:04.824 --> 00:38:06.451
Come in.

00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:08.328
Do you copy?

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:30.743
Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?

00:40:06.154 --> 00:40:08.072
That's not a Jupiter.

00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:24.839
This is Will Robinson
of the 24th Colonist Group.

00:40:25.673 --> 00:40:28.885
I'm making a record of this
because it seems...

00:40:30.136 --> 00:40:35.308
I'm the first human to discover evidence
of an alien intelligence.

00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:42.357
It... It appears it crashed when we did.

00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:45.777
Why? I don't know why.

00:40:47.403 --> 00:40:49.405
I don't even know why we crashed.

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:53.910
The... The ship has sustained
heavy amounts of damage

00:40:53.993 --> 00:40:56.204
and appears to be non-functional.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:01.292
No sign of any... pa... passengers.

00:41:11.761 --> 00:41:14.305
Hello? Anyone there?

00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:08.818
How... How can you see me?

00:42:23.332 --> 00:42:24.792
No! No!

00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:26.377
No. No.

00:42:33.176 --> 00:42:36.512
Judy, I'm back.
I'm gonna get you out of there.

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:40.683
- Where's Will?
- I'm gonna go back for him.

00:42:40.767 --> 00:42:42.810
What? What happened?

00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:44.771
We got separated, but he's okay.

00:42:44.854 --> 00:42:46.355
You just left him there?

00:42:46.439 --> 00:42:47.940
I can only save one child at a time.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.820
Better get back.

00:42:58.284 --> 00:43:01.496
Penny, how much air does she have left?

00:43:01.913 --> 00:43:03.247
Sixty-eight minutes.

00:43:07.585 --> 00:43:09.921
Judy. Close your eyes.

00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:12.298
Keep them closed.

00:43:23.851 --> 00:43:24.977
Wow.

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.694
It's working. Thank God.

00:43:33.778 --> 00:43:35.071
It was Will's idea.

00:43:35.738 --> 00:43:37.365
Yeah. I know.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.577
He thinks he doesn't deserve to be here.

00:43:43.162 --> 00:43:45.873
I'll discuss that with him
the next time I see him.

00:43:47.416 --> 00:43:48.668
When do you think that might be?

00:43:55.758 --> 00:43:56.759
Thanks.

00:44:00.638 --> 00:44:01.638
Hey.

00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:03.056
<i>Hey.</i>

00:44:04.934 --> 00:44:07.019
You're not that easy to find these days.

00:44:08.062 --> 00:44:09.564
<i>Well, that's the way they like it.</i>

00:44:10.439 --> 00:44:12.567
What with everything that's going on.

00:44:13.693 --> 00:44:14.693
<i>Right.</i>

00:44:15.695 --> 00:44:18.865
- How are the kids?
- Uh, everybody's fine.

00:44:20.408 --> 00:44:21.408
They miss me?

00:44:23.786 --> 00:44:24.786
I don't know.

00:44:31.752 --> 00:44:32.962
Why are you calling?

00:44:34.881 --> 00:44:36.048
I have good news.

00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:41.137
We have been accepted
into the 24th Colonist Group.

00:44:43.264 --> 00:44:45.600
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:44:46.225 --> 00:44:48.144
What's the timetable on that?

00:44:48.227 --> 00:44:49.562
<i>Uh, a month.</i>

00:44:49.645 --> 00:44:53.399
The kids performed sensationally.
You should be proud of them.

00:44:53.482 --> 00:44:55.318
I am. I am. Of course I am.

00:44:57.236 --> 00:44:58.362
So, I sent you some papers

00:44:58.446 --> 00:45:01.324
<i>and I just need you to sign them
and send them back.</i>

00:45:01.824 --> 00:45:03.868
So, you're finally filing for divorce?

00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:05.953
<i>No. I...</i>

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:09.916
<i>That doesn't seem necessary anymore.</i>

00:45:11.918 --> 00:45:14.712
I need your permission
so that they can go.

00:45:23.721 --> 00:45:25.306
You wanna take my kids away from me?

00:45:26.974 --> 00:45:28.559
You already left, John.

00:45:28.643 --> 00:45:30.728
- Not for forever.
<i>- After everything that's happened,</i>

00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:34.565
you have this one chance
to do what's best for them.

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.360
<i>Just...</i>

00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:40.112
sign the papers please.

00:45:41.989 --> 00:45:43.658
This isn't about us.

00:45:55.336 --> 00:45:56.336
Dad.

00:45:58.965 --> 00:46:00.049
Dad, this is Will.

00:46:00.883 --> 00:46:02.093
Do you read me?

00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:05.721
I'm kind of in a lot of danger here.

00:46:06.632 --> 00:46:08.612
Probably not as much danger as before,

00:46:08.637 --> 00:46:11.369
but definitely still in danger.

00:46:17.066 --> 00:46:20.152
That noise, I've heard it before.

00:46:20.236 --> 00:46:23.906
It's coming from your ship. Isn't it?

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:30.788
Who knows if you can even understand me.

00:46:42.341 --> 00:46:43.341
Whoa.

00:47:02.194 --> 00:47:04.822
Guess you've never seen
anything like that either.

00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:17.543
My name's Will Robinson, by the way.

00:47:19.879 --> 00:47:20.879
Wait...

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.884
what's happening to your lights?

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:40.940
Oh...

00:47:46.113 --> 00:47:47.156
You're dying.

00:47:48.908 --> 00:47:50.034
Aren't you?

00:48:08.135 --> 00:48:09.804
It's working, honey. Hold tight.

00:48:10.846 --> 00:48:11.847
<i>Oh, God.</i>

00:48:11.931 --> 00:48:13.057
That feels good.

00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:15.893
It's like my hand's been asleep
for a month.

00:48:15.976 --> 00:48:18.771
It's okay, the feeling will come back.

00:48:20.856 --> 00:48:22.399
- Magnesium.
- Magnesium.

00:48:23.692 --> 00:48:25.194
- Okay.
- Torch.

00:48:25.277 --> 00:48:26.779
Close your eyes.

00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:32.827
Okay. Okay.

00:48:54.056 --> 00:48:55.516
It's raining.

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.184
It's raining, Dad.

00:48:58.519 --> 00:49:00.187
Oh, no, no, no!

00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:03.065
Faster! Faster! It's filling up.

00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:12.283
It's... It's not raining, is it?

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:19.623
Yes. It is.

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.964
Mom, the temperature's dropping!

00:49:29.091 --> 00:49:30.509
Oh, oh...

00:49:31.218 --> 00:49:32.511
Give me the magnesium.

00:49:42.866 --> 00:49:44.565
Damn it!

00:49:48.861 --> 00:49:49.945
Damn it.

00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:53.282
<i>We're gonna get you out.</i>

00:49:56.869 --> 00:49:59.747
She's strong. She has more time.

00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:02.332
Dig!

00:50:03.584 --> 00:50:05.753
Come on! Dig!

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.880
Coming, baby!

00:50:34.156 --> 00:50:36.492
Dad. Dad, come in.

00:50:38.494 --> 00:50:42.331
Dad, there's a fire and...
and I can't get out.

00:50:46.335 --> 00:50:48.879
Dad. Dad, come in.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.946
No point in you dying, too.

00:53:27.913 --> 00:53:28.913
Thanks.

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:09.371
<i>Will! Will!</i>

00:54:10.205 --> 00:54:14.918
It's not his fault! He's gonna be...

00:54:16.587 --> 00:54:18.589
Don't talk! Just don't talk.

00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:19.923
Dad!

We're here.

00:54:26.722 --> 00:54:27.973
I'm here, baby.

00:54:29.516 --> 00:54:33.187
<i>We're here. We're here.</i>

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.231
We're right here.

00:54:39.568 --> 00:54:40.986
It's okay. We're here.

00:54:42.696 --> 00:54:43.739
We're here.

00:54:50.996 --> 00:54:53.415
What's that? What is that?

00:55:09.348 --> 00:55:10.408
It's okay.

00:55:10.474 --> 00:55:11.892
- Will?
- It's okay.

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:14.311
He's... He's with me.

00:55:26.365 --> 00:55:28.575
Danger, Will Robinson.

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.170
Can you help her?

00:55:41.922 --> 00:55:42.922
Please?

00:56:28.802 --> 00:56:30.512
I got you.

00:56:30.596 --> 00:56:31.847
- It's okay.
- Judy!

00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:34.182
- I've got you.
- Judy!

00:56:34.266 --> 00:56:35.434
Breathe!

00:56:35.517 --> 00:56:37.519
Breathe, baby! Breathe!

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:41.648
Mom!

00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:45.110
- It's okay. I got you.
- Mom.

00:56:51.116 --> 00:56:53.118
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

00:56:53.201 --> 00:56:55.954
Can you do something so we don't freeze?

It's just a temporary evacuation.

00:57:48.048 --> 00:57:50.175
I'm sure they'll have
the damage repaired soon.

00:57:52.678 --> 00:57:54.638
It seems like an overreaction.

00:57:58.058 --> 00:57:59.601
The sooner we seal the breach,

00:57:59.685 --> 00:58:02.562
the sooner we can get back to bitching
about being underpaid.

00:58:03.355 --> 00:58:04.731
We're being paid a fortune.

00:58:04.815 --> 00:58:08.193
Ah, that was before we had a chance
of being sucked out into space.

00:58:08.276 --> 00:58:09.276
Go.

00:58:19.621 --> 00:58:22.958
Get down! Get down!
It's coming, it's killing everybody!

00:58:23.041 --> 00:58:24.147
"It"?

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.888
Get him off!
Something breached the hull!

00:58:36.972 --> 00:58:39.182
Oh, God.

00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:44.270

00:58:44.312 --> 00:58:46.940

- Here. Get your coat off.

- No, I can't walk.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:58:51.445 --> 00:58:53.989
Hey, wait. What are you doing?

00:58:54.072 --> 00:58:57.325
- I'm sorry.
- What? What are you doing?

00:58:57.409 --> 00:59:00.996
