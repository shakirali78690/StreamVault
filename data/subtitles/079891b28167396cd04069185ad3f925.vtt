00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.041
Anastasia?

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.606
Stop.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.921
Cuff yourself to the bedpost.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.680
Don't bother.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.721
You look good. Healthy.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.450
Pale, though.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.649
I think maybe you live on the East Coast.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.886
For years I've been
thinking, "Where is she?

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.130
Is she close or half the world away?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.443
Is she still nervous when it thunders?

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.371
Does she remember our walks
in Coney Island?

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.967
Getting borscht from Alexa's?"

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.330
They're all there, every last one.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.646
And what do you want in exchange for this?

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.484
Just let me go.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.122
He found you faster than I thought.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.401
He did in one week
what I failed to do in 15 years.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.803
True love, huh? Ha, ha.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.440
Just take the diamonds
and consider me dead.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.404
Or what?

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.570
You've only given me half of what I want.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.962
I want him.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.929
I can't do that.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.050
If you could, you would be free.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.490
Your word?

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.689
My word.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.403
Now, how are you going to get away?

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.608
There's something else in the bag for you.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.048
Clever girl.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.530
Bye, Daddy.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.681
- Say, champ. Say, champ.
- Champ!

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.882
- Banshee, PA! What's up, baby?
- Mr. Sanchez...

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.724
...what can you tell us
about this upcoming fight?

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.962
What can I tell you about...?
I can tell you'd better...

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.761
Benjamin, this fight will cement your
credibility with the Gaming Commission.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.801
Give me another week, and I'll have us
cleared to break ground on the hotel.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.320
I must admit I had my doubts, Kai,
but you pulled it off.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.369
It's our casino.
We're putting up the purse.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.046
- He was just the middleman.
- Alex, enough.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.966
The champ is in the building, ladies and gentlemen.
The champ is in the building.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.088
Mr. Sanchez, Kai Proctor.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.004
- Welcome to Banshee.
- Glad to be here.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.925
This is Benjamin Longshadow.
His tribe runs the Kinaho Moon.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.082
- Chief.
- It's an honor to have you here.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.925
Alex Longshadow. Hey.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.290
Mr. Sanchez, if you would do us the honor, a
few shots with the casino in the background.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.927
- Man, of... Come on, man, of course.
- Right this way.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.811
Mr. Proctor, Douglas Dern,
Damien's manager.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.088
- We spoke on the phone.
- We did. Pleasure to meet you.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.363
You said the place was old.
You didn't say ancient.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.922
The Kinaho feel
a powerful connection to their past.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.488
In the case of the Kinaho Moon,
a little too powerful, in my opinion.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.087
I would have preferred to have the new
casino built before we hosted Mr. Sanchez...

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.722
...but rest assured the money is real.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.890
Yeah, it had better be.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.486
He's gonna look worse soon, I promise.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.562
Nice casino. Not bad.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.285
Not bad at all.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.686
There it is, baby.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.080
That's where I do my thing.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.850
This way, Mr. Sanchez.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.925
You don't approve.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.243
The hotel. The revenue
it will earn should be for our people.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.601
- We shouldn't be including a man like Proctor.
- A man like that gets things done quickly.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.408
We're building something that will
sustain our tribe for years to come.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.681
When I go to the spirits,
I want to have seen the start of it all.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.331
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer a hotel?
It's just a quick call.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.926
- I can have you in the presidential suite.
- No, no, no.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.009
My trailer goes wherever I go.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.288
I don't like to be too pampered
before a fight.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.126
Besides, there'll be plenty of time for that
after I put Hollister's noose up there.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.487
As agreed.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.164
Thank you.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.524
I think I like this town.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.007
We also made
some improvements on your bedroom.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.686
I think you will be pleased.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.761
Amazing Grace

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.809
How sweet...

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.691
Now I know I like this town.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:06.960
That saved a wretch like me

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.170
I once was lost

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.448
But now am found

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:28.040
Was blind, but now I see

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.402
'Twas Grace that taught...

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.526
Senator, you have the department's
deepest sympathies.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.770
- Mrs. Schumacher, I'm so, so sorry.
- Sorry for your loss.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.565
Sorry, ma'am.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.571
Sheriff Hood.
- Gordon.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.766
Hi, Deva.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.571
It's a pretty tough day for everyone.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.563
Yep.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.051
Say, why don't you join us
for dinner tonight?

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.811
Nothing fancy.
I'm just gonna grill out some burgers.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.407
- Oh, honey, you know...
- That sounds great.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.164
Thanks, Gordon.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.686
Why don't we say about 6?

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.411
Sure. See you there.
- Good.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.844
So how do you like your burger, sheriff?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.968
Uh, medium rare, thanks.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.449
- Can I see your gun?
- Yeah, sure.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.082
No. Thank you.
You don't need to see his gun.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.891
Hey, hon, why don't you, uh,
grab the sheriff another beer?

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.122
I'll get it, Mom.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.721
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.567
Here you go.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.007
- Thank you.
- Yep.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.361
So, Deva, how are you doing?

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.204
I don't know.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.284
I still can't believe it.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.841
It takes some time.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.969
- Deva, honey, would you go get...
- Yeah.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.122
Hold on, Maxie.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.608
Nice and deep, bubba.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.210
You okay?

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.408
That's the way.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.364
You good?

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.721
What's wrong with him?

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.048
It's been happening
since he was a toddler.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.571
Is he...? Is he okay?

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.330
He has good days and bad days.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.883
Huh.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:17.240
Hey, Max, why don't you go ahead
and touch the gun, just for a second.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.286
Yeah. Ha, ha.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.326
You know, sheriff,
we never got a chance to thank you...

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.801
...for pulling Deva out of that mess
the other night.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.851
Ah. So how did the arraignments go?

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.169
Well, all the men you arrested
identified this guy Hanson...

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.924
...but apparently he's long gone.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.367
And either they don't know
or won't talk about...

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.329
...where the Skulls came from.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.130
It's not that I can't guess.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.045
Whores, gambling, drugs.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.330
All crooked roads in Banshee
lead to one man, and that's Kai Proctor.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.882
I'll get us some more drinks, eh?

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.762
Great.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.444
- Alone at last.
- Shut up.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.807
What happened?

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.565
Heavy bag workout.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.127
Unh, not unless it was a bag of bones.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.765
Ana...

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.524
...it's me.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.406
Mm, no, you're different.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.721
How?

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.402
You used to be kind.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.806
You know...

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.570
...you get locked up...

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.688
...forgotten about for 15 years...

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.405
...see how kind you feel after that.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.609
- Now, I know you're angry, but...
- Angry?

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.882
You have no fucking idea.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.441
Hey, where are you going?
- Uh, I got a call. Thanks for the food.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.642
Look, um, you wanna talk about it?

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.925
Drinking alone?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.526
To keeping secrets.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.523
Hey, um...

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.210
Rebecca.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.724
Rebecca.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.129
I think you should go home.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.521
No, you don't.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.287
What, are you saving yourself for someone?

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.641
- Rebecca, we can't...
- Shut up.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.642
Look, you told me to call
if she came back again.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.007
Well, she's back.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.768
Hi, Uncle Kai.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.084
Don't you think you're getting a little
too old for this rebel streak of yours?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.321
That's rich coming from you.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.247
Whatever you may think,
my choices have cost me dearly.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.325
Yeah. You're really hurting.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.370
My mother lives just 10 miles
away from me.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.569
I haven't seen or spoken to her
in over 20 years.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.685
My father, when I run into him,
won't even fucking look at me.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.481
My sister, your mother,
denies I even exist.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.883
Yeah, well, that's why
they call it being shunned.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.087
Show some respect!

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.369
I'm sorry, uncle.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.524
You can't begin
to understand how alone I am.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:11.562
I've lost count of the people I hurt
and still I hurt people every day.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.963
You have no idea
what that does to you inside.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.886
It's like a blade in your belly
that has gradually scraped you raw.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.406
I'm not buying it, uncle.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.161
You have everything
you've ever wanted.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.809
You're free.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.889
Why don't you just admit
that you like being bad?

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.408
Do you realize
no one else can talk to me like that?

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.485
You're the only person
who isn't scared of me.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.802
The only one.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.843
I'll drive you home.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.568
I want to welcome
our Camp Genoa Marines...

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.963
...to view a private sparring session
with the champ.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.770
All right, ladies and gentlemen...

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.169
...let me introduce a man
who needs no introduction.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.891
Two-time cruiservveight
champion of the world...

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.327
...honorary referee for
this weekend's fight...

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.927
...Banshee's own Sugar Bates!

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.170
Now, a special gift for Mr. Sanchez...

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.369
...from our sponsors
at Stark-Himmel Timepieces:

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.002
A solid gold watch
with a one-of-a-kind diamond bezel...

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.128
...designed especially for the champ.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.005
This is yours. Wear it well.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.091
You got my invitation for the cocktail
party tomorrow and the fight on Saturday?

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.244
I did.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.483
Hey, listen, man, I wanna give
a semper fi to all my jarheads...

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.405
- ...from Banshee's Camp Genoa, all right?
Ooh-rah!

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.245
Seems like you're always
hosting something around here.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.964
Y'all ready to see me whup some ass?

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.009
Yeah!

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.049
You just came in to see him train?

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.601
No. Actually, I came to see you.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.245
You heard about the Schumacher boy
OD'ing, right?

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.287
Yeah, I did. It's terrible.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.488
Proctor, you told me you had a talent
for resolving problems here in Banshee.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.440
I was kind of hoping
you could help me with this one.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.651
I found these in the dead boy's pocket.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.042
The kids call them Skulls.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.646
You ever seen pills like that before?

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.161
Are you asking me or accusing me?

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.687
Heh. Why, I'm asking you, Kai.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.442
Just don't play games with me, sheriff.
I'm well aware of Mayor Kendall's agenda.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.210
Oh, this has nothing to do
with Kendall.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.761
The boy means well, but he's an idiot.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.127
On that at least I'm sure we can agree.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.521
So if you'll excuse me...

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.687
...I'm busy trying to bring
good things to Banshee.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.290
Thanks for your time.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.210
Oh!

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.801
- Asshole.
- What?

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.247
You gotta watch me.
If you blink, it's over.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.404
He didn't have to hit him that hard.
They're just sparring.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.922
Damn, I'm out of partners.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.650
Here! Sarge will take you on!

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.284
Hey, hey, hey.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.363
Ahem. 5-0.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.204
Yeah, sheriff.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.210
You want a shot at the title?

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.329
Huh? You can't throw a few punches?

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.809
Go easy on him.
I'd be scared of me too.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.485
You're the champ!

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.646
The sheriff too smart.
He don't wanna step in the ring.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.404
He don't want none of this.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.725
Excuse me, excuse me.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.450
Hey. Can you come here?

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.045
Hey, hey. Hey, doll.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.521
- How you doing? What's your name?
- Chloe.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.126
Hey, uh, Chloe,
can you bring me a bottle of champagne?

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.049
Sure. I'll be right back.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.730
No, doll.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.564
Can you bring it to my trailer?

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.926
Say, tonight around 11?

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.769
- All right, Mr. Sanchez.
- All right, Chloe.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.246
All right.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.005
Come on in.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.680
Hmm.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.524
Must be 11.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.962
They're all there.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.563
Just take them and go.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.246
You can start a new life somewhere.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.964
You deserve that after everything
you've been through.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.966
You think you can buy me off?

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.406
Huh?

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.728
You listen to me.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.562
I'm not going anywhere.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.922
So take your fucking diamonds
and get out.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.765
You want a bump?

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.210
I never have.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.245
I'll try.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.644
Yeah, fuck me harder.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.651
Heh. No, no, no, no.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.929
No, doll, no. Not like that.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.482
Like this.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.924
You like it like that?

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.447
Fuck me harder!

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.044
Ah, you're hurting me.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.724
No! Get off me!

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.123
- Stop it!
- Shut the fuck up!

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.801
- Fucking bitch!
- Ah!

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.005
Oh, my head!

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.169
We have combed the entire building,
reviewed all security footage.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.846
She left absolutely nothing behind.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.401
But she came.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.165
She walked right into the lion's den.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.404
He has become a threat to her.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.682
He has been locked up for 15 years.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.160
He's sick with love.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.322
He is reckless.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.608
And rusty.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.563
He'll make a mistake.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.848
He already did.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.526
He scared her.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.767
I thought this was your day off.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.646
I don't have much of a social life.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.602
Do you miss being home?

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.048
You don't really talk about it.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.011
It must be hard coming to a new town
not knowing anyone.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.285
I'm used to being alone.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.685
I'll never get used to it.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.084
Sheriff.
- Yeah.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.605
You need to get over to the hospital.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.804
Chloe, I'm so sorry
I have to ask these questions.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.087
I'm almost done, okay?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.722
So you and Mr. Sanchez,
being in bed together was consensual?

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.527
Until it got rough.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.329
I did something wrong and he just...

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.562
Chloe, look at me.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.769
You did nothing wrong, okay?

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.489
He kicked me and then he punched me.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:27.567
I was crawling. I was trying to get
away, but he... He wouldn't let...

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.165
Then he took the champagne bottle...

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.124
Okay.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.607
I'm gonna go, uh, talk to your nurse, okay?

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.887
Hey, hey, hey. We've got nothing.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.929
Even the overflow lot is filled.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.970
You're gonna wanna try down the way... Hey!

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.929
Found a spot.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.608
Oh, crap.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.169
Sheriff Hood.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.726
I've heard about the girl.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.445
How is she?

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.967
Well, she looks like she
was hit by a train.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.330
I know this is a delicate situation, but
I'm going to ask you to arrest Sanchez...

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.925
...after the fight tomorrow night.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.082
- What?
- Yeah, I know how it sounds...

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.130
...but Banshee needs this fight to happen.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.851
Too many people and businesses
stand to lose if it doesn't.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.810
- Are you out of your mind? That girl...
- Hey, deputy, give us a minute.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.485
- You're gonna discuss this...
- Hey.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.802
- You saw what he did to that girl.
- Calm down right now.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.327
Are you just another one
of Proctor's yes-men now? That it?

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.766
"Meet the new boss,
same as the old boss."

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:25.527
Sheriff, I just wanted to thank you
for your discretion.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.409
These things can always be handled.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.403
"These things"?

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.130
So this has happened before?

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.884
You know the deal.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.280
Tomorrow I'll go visit the girl.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.522
She'll put on a show, but ultimately...

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.361
...it always comes down to the number in their
mind from the moment they decided to fuck him.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.528
- Yeah? Dern, right?
- Yeah.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.923
Yeah, you need to go somewhere
I can't see you and stay there.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.526
Hey, I mean, come on...

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.411
- Hood.
- Hey, hey.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.411
Five-O, that was not cool.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.369
Benny was just doing his job.
What the fuck?

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:10.005
You're under arrest
for rape and aggravated assault.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.649
I'm under arrest?

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.405
Okay.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.410
Yeah, I'm under arrest. All right, yeah.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.204
Come and get me.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.448
Sheriff.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.250
Sheriff.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.366
Gotta watch me.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.448
That is cute. I like that.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.129
Looks like you're not too smart after all.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.247
This what you wanna do?

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.765
Ladies and gentlemen, amateur hour.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.763
Let's go.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.528
Come on, sheriff, let's go.

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.043
Get up, bitch!

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.844
Get out of my way. Move! Move.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.331
Hood.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.248
Get the fuck off of me.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.562
Come on, Champ.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.688
Fuck.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.048
You like hitting little girls?

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.129
Huh?

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.121
You motherfucker!

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.643
Oh. my God!

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.121
Hood, enough!

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.607
Meet the new boss.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.681
This is Deputy Kelly. We need
an ambulance at the Kinaho Moon Casino.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.521
Sugar here. Come on.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.244
I got you.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.643
All right. Let's walk, hmm?

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.806
All right.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.766
So you're just the kind of guy
who makes friends wherever he goes, huh?

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.048
- Ha, ha.
- Yeah, it's all right.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.724
- Shit.
- Just open the door.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.083
Come on.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.043
Whoo.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.720
Whoa. I always wanted
to drive one of these.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.004
You cost me a referee gig tonight, brother.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.845
And I could have used the scratch.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.484
Ha. Alrighty.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.331
Here we go.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.926
- What's going on, Kai?
- He in there?

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.165
Yeah, but, uh, he's not fit for a visit.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.765
So now you're his gatekeeper?

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.763
It's okay, Sugar.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.362
It's all right.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.966
You cost a lot of people
a lot of money tonight.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.049
You cost me a lot of money tonight.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.528
Why don't you take it up with Sanchez.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.762
Can I help you with something, Mr. Proctor?

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.967
I always had very good relations
with your predecessors.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.805
Yeah, you bought them.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.080
Sometimes laws need to be bent or broken
for the greater good.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.083
I know you agree with that.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.005
No. No, you know nothing about me.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.084
Well, clearly not as much as I should.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.842
There's a lot you don't know as well.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.766
My family's been here for 160 years.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.082
I've lived here my entire life.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.322
I am this town.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.883
I helped build it and I bled for it.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.322
Have you ever loved anything like that?

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.129
I have.

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:29.047
You see, people here don't always approve
of the way I go about things.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.204
But from what I've seen
since you got here...

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.402
...you're not very different
from me in that regard.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.565
So what puzzles me is why you seem
to hold me in such contempt.

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.691
I have no contempt for you.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.088
I'm just not afraid of you.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.160
I think maybe you're not used to that.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.444
See, you call yourself a businessman...

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.887
...and you dress well, you speak well...

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.089
...but you're still
nothing but a petty thug.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.084
You've been doing it so long,
you actually think it makes sense...

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.083
...to show up here
in the middle of the night...

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.528
...and ask me why you can't own me
like you own everyone else.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.042
That makes you delusional...

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.961
...which makes you dangerous.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.929
Why would I want to get in bed
with someone like that?

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:27.641
Sheriff, do you know why
they're afraid of me?

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.369
Why is that?

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.326
Because they should be.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.887
And maybe you should be too.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.724
Why don't you show me why right now?

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.285
Nah.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.964
I haven't given up on you just yet.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.921
You have a good night.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.921
You're not understanding me. He's done.

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.484
He's done permanently!

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.689
The sheriff fucked him up really bad.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.043
I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't seen it myself.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.926
No, look, look.
They already arrested him.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.570
I'm cutting my fucking losses.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.161
I never should've come
to this jerkwater town.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.731
I gotta call you back.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.360
- Mr. Dern.
- I'm a little busy here.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.403
I imagine so. I won't waste your time.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.130
I'm here to pick up the satchel.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.562
What the fuck are you talking about?

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.401
You were paid an agreed-upon sum of cash
to deliver the fight to the Kinaho Moon.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.369
Clearly, the fight is off.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.010
And while Mr. Proctor does not hold...

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.205
...Mr. Sanchez's reckless behavior
against you personally...

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.170
...he does expect his money to be returned.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.243
Well, listen to me, little man.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.767
Proctor assured me
that he'd buy us enough time...

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.163
...to pay off that little skank,
so he's the one that didn't come through.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.765
And as far as the money...

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.048
...tell him it's the
cost of doing business.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.126
And if he knows what's good for him,
he'll leave it at that.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.009
Now I'm gonna go finish packing...

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.369
so I can get the fuck out of this shithole!

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.089
What are you doing here, asshole?

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.449
I told you... What the fuck is that?

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.120
Hey, wait. Now, now, don't.
Come on. Just back off.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.886
Hey... Ow! Ahh! Ahh!

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.201
Ahh, don't! Stop!
