00:01:25.954 --> 00:01:28.289
Anastasia?

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:31.093
Stop.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.435
Cuff yourself to the bedpost.

00:01:46.778 --> 00:01:49.346
Don't bother.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.107
You look good. Healthy.

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:19.013
Pale, though. I think maybe
you live on the East Coast.

00:02:19.047 --> 00:02:24.351
For years I've been thinking...
"Where is she?

00:02:24.386 --> 00:02:28.522
Is she close or half the world away?

00:02:28.556 --> 00:02:32.660
Is she still nervous when it thunders?

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:36.697
Does she remember
our walks in Coney Island?

00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:40.168
Getting borscht from Alexa's?"

00:02:48.678 --> 00:02:51.847
They're all there, every last one.

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.127
And what do you want
in exchange for this?

00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:06.997
Just let me go.

00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:13.471
He found you faster than I thought.

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:19.877
<i>He did in one week
what I failed to do in 15 years.</i>

00:03:19.912 --> 00:03:23.248
True love, huh?

00:03:23.282 --> 00:03:25.917
Just take the diamonds
and consider me dead.

00:03:25.952 --> 00:03:27.819
<i>Or what?</i>

00:03:27.854 --> 00:03:31.056
You've only given me
half of what I want.

00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:38.396
- I want him.
- I can't do that.

00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:41.533
If you could, you would be free.

00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:50.977
Your word?

00:03:52.113 --> 00:03:54.214
My word.

00:03:56.884 --> 00:04:01.788
Now...
how are you going to get away?

00:04:01.822 --> 00:04:04.157
There's something else
in the bag for you.

00:04:09.897 --> 00:04:13.867
<i>Clever Girl.</i>

00:04:35.323 --> 00:04:37.825
Bye, Daddy.

00:06:16.222 --> 00:06:18.056
what can you tell us
about this upcoming fight?

00:06:18.091 --> 00:06:20.425
What can I tell you about...
I can tell you'd better...

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.661
Benjamin, this fight will
cement your credibility

00:06:22.696 --> 00:06:24.096
with the Gaming Commission.

00:06:24.131 --> 00:06:26.332
Give me another week,
and I'll have us cleared

00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:29.302
to break ground on the hotel.

00:06:29.336 --> 00:06:35.776
I must admit I had my doubts, Kai,
but you pulled it off.

00:06:35.843 --> 00:06:37.844
It's our casino.
We're putting up the purse.

00:06:37.878 --> 00:06:40.514
<i>- He was just the middleman.
- Alex, enough.</i>

00:06:40.548 --> 00:06:42.549
<i>The champ is in the
building, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:44.417
<i>The champ is in the building.</i>

00:06:44.452 --> 00:06:46.553
Mr. Sanchez, Kai Proctor.

00:06:46.587 --> 00:06:48.454
- Welcome to Banshee.
- Glad to be here.

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:51.224
This is Benjamin Longshadow.
His tribe runs the Kinaho Moon.

00:06:51.258 --> 00:06:53.526
- Chief.
- It's an honor to have you here.

00:06:53.594 --> 00:06:56.395
- Alex Longshadow.
- Oh, 'kay.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.531
Mr. Sanchez, if you
would do us the honor...

00:06:58.565 --> 00:07:00.767
a few shots with the
casino in the background.

00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:04.403
- Man, of... come on, man, of course.
- Right this way.

00:07:04.438 --> 00:07:07.340
Mr. Proctor,
Douglas Dern, Damien's manager.

00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:09.575
- We spoke on the phone.
- We did. Pleasure to meet you.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.779
You said the place was old.
You didn't say ancient.

00:07:12.813 --> 00:07:16.316
The Kinaho feel a powerful
connection to their past.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.020
<i>In the case of the Kinaho Moon,
a little too powerful, in my opinion.</i>

00:07:20.054 --> 00:07:21.888
I would have preferred to
have the new casino built

00:07:21.922 --> 00:07:27.160
before we hosted Mr. Sanchez,
but rest assured the money is real.

00:07:27.195 --> 00:07:30.264
Yeah, it had better be.

00:07:30.299 --> 00:07:33.001
<i>He's gonna look worse soon, I promise.</i>

00:07:34.603 --> 00:07:38.572
<i>Nice casino. Not bad.</i>

00:07:40.408 --> 00:07:42.843
<i>Not bad at all.</i>

00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:51.185
There it is, baby.

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:54.388
<i>- That's where I do my thing.
- This way, Mr. Sanchez.</i>

00:07:58.226 --> 00:08:00.495
You don't approve.

00:08:03.332 --> 00:08:06.735
The hotel... the revenue it will
earn should be for our people.

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:08.270
We shouldn't be including
a man like Proctor.

00:08:08.304 --> 00:08:13.108
A man like that
gets things done quickly.

00:08:13.142 --> 00:08:17.979
We're building something that will
sustain our tribe for years to come.

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:25.186
When I go to the spirits,
I want to have seen the start of it all.

00:09:17.107 --> 00:09:19.809
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer
a hotel? It's just a quick call.

00:09:19.844 --> 00:09:21.770
I can have you in
the presidential suite.

00:09:21.771 --> 00:09:24.481
No, no, no.
My trailer goes wherever I go.

00:09:24.515 --> 00:09:26.650
I don't like to be too
pampered before a fight.

00:09:26.684 --> 00:09:28.718
Besides, there'll be
plenty of time for that

00:09:28.753 --> 00:09:30.620
after I put Hollister's noose up there.

00:09:30.655 --> 00:09:33.023
As agreed.

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:36.660
Thank you.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:40.831
I think I like this town.

00:09:40.866 --> 00:09:43.301
We also made some
improvements on your bedroom.

Hi, Deva.

00:11:12.125 --> 00:11:15.027
It's a pretty tough day for everyone.

00:11:15.062 --> 00:11:17.062
Yep.

00:11:20.767 --> 00:11:23.369
Say, why don't you join
us for dinner tonight?

00:11:23.403 --> 00:11:26.238
Nothing fancy; I'm just gonna grill
out some burgers in the back yard.

00:11:26.272 --> 00:11:31.744
- Oh, honey, you know...
- That sounds great. Thanks, Gordon.

00:11:32.746 --> 00:11:34.180
Why don't we say about 6:00?

00:11:34.214 --> 00:11:36.916
- Sure. See you there.
- Good.

00:11:44.257 --> 00:11:46.325
So, how do you like
your burger, Sheriff?

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.494
Medium rare, thanks.

00:11:50.897 --> 00:11:52.931
- Can I see your gun?
- Yeah, sure.

00:11:52.966 --> 00:11:56.401
No. Thank you.
You don't need to see his gun.

00:11:56.435 --> 00:11:59.337
Hey, hon', why don't you
grab the Sheriff another beer?

00:11:59.371 --> 00:12:01.639
I'll get it, Mom.

00:12:01.674 --> 00:12:04.242
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

00:12:09.748 --> 00:12:10.915
Here you go.

00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:13.484
- Thank you.
- Yep.

00:12:16.388 --> 00:12:18.890
So, Deva, how are you doing?

00:12:20.793 --> 00:12:25.797
I don't know.
I still can't believe it.

00:12:25.832 --> 00:12:28.300
Yeah. It takes some time.

00:12:30.436 --> 00:12:34.640
- Deva, honey, would you go get...
- Yeah. Hold on, Maxie.

00:12:38.812 --> 00:12:41.113
Nice and deep, bubba.

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:44.650
You okay?

00:12:44.684 --> 00:12:46.919
That's the way.

00:12:48.054 --> 00:12:49.888
<i> You good?</i>

00:12:54.995 --> 00:12:56.095
What's wrong with him?

00:12:56.129 --> 00:12:58.531
It's been happening
since he was a toddler.

00:13:00.133 --> 00:13:04.870
- Is he... is he okay?
- He has good days and bad days.

00:13:11.245 --> 00:13:13.996
Hey, Max,
why don't you go ahead

00:13:13.997 --> 00:13:17.783
and touch the gun
just for a second?

00:13:22.322 --> 00:13:23.458
Yeah.

00:13:29.162 --> 00:13:31.731
<i> You know, Sheriff,
we never got a chance</i>

00:13:31.732 --> 00:13:34.300
<i>to thank you for pulling Deva
out of that mess the other night.</i>

00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:38.338
Aw. So how
did the arraignments go?

00:13:38.372 --> 00:13:41.441
Well, all the men you arrested
identified this guy Hanson,

00:13:41.475 --> 00:13:42.943
<i>but apparently he's long gone.</i>

00:13:42.977 --> 00:13:45.745

know or won't talk about</i>

<i>where the skulls came from.
It's not that I can't guess.</i>

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.553
Whores, gambling, drugs.

00:13:52.587 --> 00:13:54.721
All crooked roads in
Banshee lead to one man,

00:13:54.756 --> 00:13:56.857
and that's Kai Proctor.

00:14:01.262 --> 00:14:06.299
- I'll get us some more drinks, eh?
- Great.

00:14:13.808 --> 00:14:16.943
- Alone at last.
- Shut up.

00:14:20.147 --> 00:14:22.248
What happened?

00:14:25.552 --> 00:14:27.120
Heavy bag workout.

00:14:28.655 --> 00:14:33.660
Mm, not unless it was a bag of bones.

00:14:40.368 --> 00:14:43.238
Ana...

00:14:43.272 --> 00:14:48.844
- it's me.
- Mm, no, you're different.

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:50.279
How?

00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:54.951
You used to be kind.

00:15:00.625 --> 00:15:03.360
You know...

00:15:03.394 --> 00:15:07.297
you get locked up,
forgotten about for 15 years,

00:15:07.331 --> 00:15:08.598
see how kind you feel after that.

00:15:08.633 --> 00:15:12.135
- Now, I know you're angry, but...
- Angry?

00:15:12.169 --> 00:15:14.404
You have no fuckin' idea.

00:15:23.614 --> 00:15:25.282
<i> Hey, where are you going?</i>

00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:28.285
Uh, I got a call.
Thanks for the food.

00:18:30.769 --> 00:18:34.572
Yeah. You're really hurting.

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:38.569
<i>let me introduce a man
who needs no introduction...</i>

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:41.272
<i>two-time cruiserweight
champion of the world,</i>

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:43.841
<i>honorary referee for
this weekend's fight,</i>

00:20:43.876 --> 00:20:46.810
<i>Banshee's own Sugar Bates!</i>

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:55.686
<i>Now, a special gift for Mr. Sanchez</i>

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.856
<i>from our sponsors at
Stark-Himmel Timepieces...</i>

00:20:58.891 --> 00:21:02.526
<i>a solid gold watch with a
one-of-a-kind diamond bezel</i>

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:04.461
<i>designed especially for the champ.</i>

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:07.564
<i>This is yours. Wear it well.</i>

00:21:07.598 --> 00:21:10.334
You got my invitation
for the cocktail party tomorrow

00:21:10.335 --> 00:21:12.327
- and the fight on Saturday?
- I did.

00:21:12.328 --> 00:21:14.503
<i>Thank you, gentlemen.</i>

00:21:14.538 --> 00:21:17.973
<i>Hey, listen, man, I wanna give
a semper fi to all my jarheads</i>

00:21:18.008 --> 00:21:20.910
<i>from Banshee's Camp Genoa, all right?</i>

00:21:20.944 --> 00:21:23.812
Seems like you're always
hosting something around here.

00:21:25.582 --> 00:21:27.483
<i>Y'all ready to see me whip some ass?</i>

00:21:27.517 --> 00:21:29.418
<i>- Yeah!
- Yeah!</i>

00:21:29.453 --> 00:21:31.554
You just came in to see him train?

00:21:31.588 --> 00:21:34.223
No. Actually, I came to see you.

00:21:35.726 --> 00:21:38.894
You heard about the
Schumacher boy OD'ing, right?

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.833
Yeah, I did. It's terrible.

00:21:46.337 --> 00:21:51.074
Proctor, you told me you had a talent
for resolving problems here in Banshee.

00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:56.012
I was kind of hoping you
could help me with this one.

00:21:57.448 --> 00:22:00.285
I found these
in the dead boy's pocket.

00:22:01.387 --> 00:22:06.157
The kids call them "skulls."
You ever seen pills like that before?

00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:08.626
Are you asking me or accusing me?

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.262
Why, I'm asking you, Kai.

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:14.098
Just don't play games with me, Sheriff.

00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:15.966
I'm well aware of
Mayor Kendall's agenda.

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.734
Oh, this has nothing to do with Kendall.

00:22:17.769 --> 00:22:20.270
The boy means well, but he's an idiot.

00:22:20.305 --> 00:22:25.041
On that at least I'm sure we can agree.
So if you'll excuse me...

00:22:26.844 --> 00:22:29.278
I'm busy trying to bring
good things to Banshee.

00:22:31.014 --> 00:22:32.847
Thanks for your time.

00:22:47.496 --> 00:22:50.197
- Asshole.
- What?

00:22:50.232 --> 00:22:52.700
You gotta watch me.
If you blink, it's over.

00:22:52.734 --> 00:22:56.003
He didn't have to hit him that
hard. They're just sparring.

00:22:59.274 --> 00:23:01.409
<i> Damn, I'm out of partners.</i>

00:23:01.443 --> 00:23:03.544
<i> Right here!
Sarge will take you on!</i>

00:23:05.948 --> 00:23:07.748
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

00:23:07.783 --> 00:23:11.819
Ahem. 5-0.
Yeah, Sheriff.

00:23:13.021 --> 00:23:14.755
You want a shot at the title?

00:23:18.293 --> 00:23:19.894
Huh?
You can't throw a few punches?

00:23:27.036 --> 00:23:30.104
Go easy on him.
I'd be scared of me, too.

00:23:30.138 --> 00:23:32.239
<i> You're the champ!</i>

00:23:32.274 --> 00:23:33.507
<i> The Sheriff too smart.</i>

00:23:33.542 --> 00:23:36.844
He don't wanna step in the ring.
He don't want none of this.

00:23:42.183 --> 00:23:44.218
Excuse me, excuse me.

00:23:44.252 --> 00:23:45.886
<i>Hey. Can you come here?</i>

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.488
Hey, hey. Hey, doll.

00:23:47.522 --> 00:23:50.023
- How you doing? What's your name?
- Chloe.

00:23:50.058 --> 00:23:52.526
Hey, um, Chloe, can you bring
me a bottle of champagne?

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.229
- Sure. I'll be right back.
- No, doll.

00:23:56.264 --> 00:23:59.432
Can you bring it to my trailer?
Say, tonight around 11:00?

00:24:05.105 --> 00:24:08.207
- All right, Mr. Sanchez.
- All right, Chloe.

00:24:08.242 --> 00:24:09.776
<i>All right.</i>

00:24:14.982 --> 00:24:18.418
Come on in.

00:24:20.688 --> 00:24:24.092
Hmm.
Must be 11:00.

00:25:06.167 --> 00:25:08.502
<i>They're all there.</i>

00:25:13.108 --> 00:25:17.846
Just take them and go.
You can start a new life somewhere.

00:25:19.316 --> 00:25:22.518
You deserve that after
everything you've been through.

00:25:37.902 --> 00:25:43.073
You think you can buy me off? Huh?

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:48.780
You listen to me.
I'm not going anywhere.

00:25:48.814 --> 00:25:52.450
So take your fuckin'
diamonds and get out.

00:26:21.813 --> 00:26:26.751
- You want a bump?
- I never have.

00:26:31.157 --> 00:26:32.791
I'll try.

00:26:34.261 --> 00:26:36.229
Yeah, fuck me harder.

00:26:37.698 --> 00:26:39.166
No, no, no, no.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.836
No, doll, no. Not like that.

00:26:42.871 --> 00:26:45.005
Like this.

00:26:50.546 --> 00:26:52.481
You like it like that?

00:26:59.588 --> 00:27:02.057
Fuck me harder!

00:27:19.708 --> 00:27:21.609
Ah, you're hurting me.

00:27:25.247 --> 00:27:28.249
No! Get off me!

00:27:28.283 --> 00:27:32.353
- Don't!
- Shut the fuck up!

00:27:39.862 --> 00:27:42.764
- Fucking bitch!
- Ah!

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.541
Oh, my head!

00:28:01.285 --> 00:28:05.621
We have combed the entire building,
reviewed all security footage.

00:28:05.655 --> 00:28:11.593
- She left absolutely nothing behind.
- But she came.

00:28:11.627 --> 00:28:15.796
She walked right into the lion's den.

00:28:16.965 --> 00:28:20.000
He has become a threat to her.

00:28:21.236 --> 00:28:27.674
He has been locked up for 15 years.
He's sick with love.

00:28:27.709 --> 00:28:33.014
He is reckless.
And rusty.

00:28:34.082 --> 00:28:36.183
He'll make a mistake.

00:28:37.085 --> 00:28:42.090
He already did.
He scared her.

00:28:48.798 --> 00:28:51.032
I thought this was your day off.

00:28:52.468 --> 00:28:55.236
I don't have much of a social life.

00:28:58.841 --> 00:29:04.613
Do you miss being home?
You don't really talk about it.

00:29:08.852 --> 00:29:11.487
It must be hard coming to
a new town not knowing anyone.

00:29:12.824 --> 00:29:15.892
I'm used to being alone.

00:29:20.398 --> 00:29:23.166
I'll never get used to it.

00:29:42.717 --> 00:29:44.551
- Sheriff.
- Yeah.

00:29:44.585 --> 00:29:46.219
You need to get over to the hospital.

00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:53.827
<i>Chloe, I'm so sorry
I have to ask these questions.</i>

00:29:55.861 --> 00:29:58.365
<i>I'm almost done, okay?</i>

00:29:58.399 --> 00:29:59.900
So you and Mr. Sanchez...

00:29:59.967 --> 00:30:03.304
<i>being in bed together was consensual?</i>

00:30:04.673 --> 00:30:07.041
Until it got rough.

00:30:08.878 --> 00:30:10.813
I did something wrong
and he just...

00:30:10.847 --> 00:30:14.082
Chloe, look at me.

00:30:14.117 --> 00:30:17.319
You did nothing wrong, okay?

00:30:19.756 --> 00:30:22.925
He kicked me
and then he punched me.

00:30:22.959 --> 00:30:25.394
I was crawling.
I was trying to get away,

00:30:25.429 --> 00:30:28.030
<i>but he...
he wouldn't let...</i>

00:30:28.064 --> 00:30:32.668
then he...
took the champagne bottle...

00:30:35.772 --> 00:30:37.473
<i> Okay.</i>

00:30:38.642 --> 00:30:41.210
I'm gonna go talk to your nurse, okay?

00:31:06.903 --> 00:31:09.305
Hey, hey, hey.
We've got nothing.

00:31:09.339 --> 00:31:11.341
Even the overflow lot is filled.

00:31:11.375 --> 00:31:14.477
You're gonna wanna
try down the way... hey!

00:31:18.516 --> 00:31:20.450
Found a spot.

00:31:35.934 --> 00:31:38.203
Oh, crap.

00:31:40.739 --> 00:31:42.673
Sheriff Hood.

00:31:44.677 --> 00:31:47.945
I've heard about the girl.
How is she?

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.448
Well, she looks like
she was hit by a train.

00:31:50.482 --> 00:31:52.450
I know this is a delicate situation,

00:31:52.484 --> 00:31:54.886
but I'm going to ask you
to arrest Sanchez

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.354
after the fight tomorrow night.

00:31:56.388 --> 00:31:58.590
- What?
- Yeah, I know how it sounds,

00:31:58.624 --> 00:32:01.560
but Banshee
needs this fight to happen.

00:32:01.594 --> 00:32:04.018
Too many people and businesses
stand to lose if it doesn't.

00:32:04.019 --> 00:32:05.773
Are you out of your mind?!
That girl...

00:32:05.774 --> 00:32:07.299
Hey, hey, Deputy, give us a minute.

00:32:07.334 --> 00:32:09.034
- You're actually gonna discuss this...
- Hey, hey, hey.

00:32:09.069 --> 00:32:11.036
- You saw what he did to that girl.
- Calm down right now.

00:32:11.071 --> 00:32:14.507
Are you just another one of
Proctor's yes-men now? Is that it?

00:32:14.541 --> 00:32:17.377
"Meet the new boss,
same as the old boss."

00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:26.053
Sheriff, I just wanted to thank you
for your discretion.

00:32:26.087 --> 00:32:27.954
These things can always be handled.

00:32:27.988 --> 00:32:31.591
"These things"?
So this has happened before?

00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:34.760
You know the deal...
tomorrow I'll go visit the girl.

00:32:34.795 --> 00:32:37.062
She'll put on a show, but ultimately,

00:32:37.097 --> 00:32:39.231
it always comes down to the
number they had in their mind

00:32:39.265 --> 00:32:40.866
from the moment they
decided to fuck him.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.001
- Yeah? Dern, right?
- Yeah.

00:32:43.036 --> 00:32:46.338
Yeah, you need to go somewhere
I can't see you and stay there.

00:32:46.372 --> 00:32:49.006
Hey, I mean, come on...

00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:52.443
- Hood.
- Hey, hey.

00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:03.756
5-0, that was not cool.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.858
Benny was just doing his
job, man. What the fuck?

00:33:05.892 --> 00:33:09.361
You're under arrest
for rape and aggravated assault.

00:33:12.199 --> 00:33:14.801
I'm under arrest?

00:33:18.238 --> 00:33:22.942
Okay. Yeah, I'm under arrest.
All right, yeah.

00:33:22.976 --> 00:33:24.810
Come and get me.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.018
Sheriff.

00:33:37.192 --> 00:33:38.759
Sheriff.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.735
Gotta watch me.

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:51.372
That is cute. I like that.

00:33:52.607 --> 00:33:54.708
Looks like you're not
too smart after all.

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:59.346
This what you wanna do?

00:33:59.381 --> 00:34:02.216
Ladies and gentlemen, amateur hour.

00:34:02.284 --> 00:34:04.853
Let's go.

00:34:34.884 --> 00:34:37.119
<i> Come on, Sheriff, let's go.</i>

00:34:51.502 --> 00:34:53.603
Get up, bitch!

00:35:02.346 --> 00:35:05.315
Get out of my way. Move! Move.

00:35:05.383 --> 00:35:07.184
Hood.

00:35:31.607 --> 00:35:33.775
Get the fuck off of me.

00:35:35.877 --> 00:35:38.078
Come on, Champ.

00:36:20.153 --> 00:36:22.221
Fuck.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:27.628
You like hitting little girls?
Huh?

00:36:41.177 --> 00:36:43.678
You motherfucker!

00:36:54.424 --> 00:36:56.725
Oh. my God!

00:37:17.279 --> 00:37:19.613
<i> Hood, enough!</i>

00:38:16.704 --> 00:38:19.106
Meet the new boss.

00:38:24.379 --> 00:38:26.413
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

00:38:26.448 --> 00:38:29.316
<i>Anything you say or do can and
will be held against you in...</i>

00:38:31.552 --> 00:38:36.757
<i>Sugar here. Come on.
I got you.</i>

00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:42.329
<i>All right.
Let's walk, hmm? All right.</i>

00:38:42.363 --> 00:38:43.863
So you're just the kind of guy

00:38:43.898 --> 00:38:46.266
who makes friends wherever he goes, huh?

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.634
Yeah, it's all right.

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:58.245
- Shit.
- Just open the door.

00:39:11.325 --> 00:39:15.696
Whoa. I always wanted
to drive one of these.

00:39:19.467 --> 00:39:22.403
You cost me a referee
gig tonight, brother.

00:39:22.438 --> 00:39:25.373
And I could have used the scratch.

00:39:36.921 --> 00:39:41.759
Ha. All righty.
Here we go.

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.881
<i>♪ Wait ♪</i>

00:40:05.451 --> 00:40:08.787
<i>♪ Take all this pain ♪</i>

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:14.459
<i>♪ Take it away ♪</i>

00:40:17.463 --> 00:40:20.900
<i>♪ Take it away... ♪</i>

00:40:56.737 --> 00:40:59.439
- What's going on, Kai?
- He in there?

00:40:59.473 --> 00:41:03.710
<i>Yeah, but he's not fit for a visit.</i>

00:41:03.744 --> 00:41:05.312
<i> So now you're his gatekeeper?</i>

00:41:05.379 --> 00:41:08.315
It's okay, Sugar.

00:41:14.756 --> 00:41:16.892
It's all right.

00:41:16.926 --> 00:41:19.428
You cost a lot of people
a lot of money tonight.

00:41:19.463 --> 00:41:21.631
You cost me a lot of money tonight.

00:41:22.967 --> 00:41:25.134
Why don't you take it up with Sanchez?

00:41:30.841 --> 00:41:34.344
Can I help you with
something, Mr. Proctor?

00:41:36.914 --> 00:41:40.484
I always had very good
relations with your predecessors.

00:41:40.518 --> 00:41:43.020
Yeah, you bought them.

00:41:44.789 --> 00:41:48.625
Sometimes laws need to be bent
or broken for the greater good.

00:41:48.659 --> 00:41:50.627
I know you agree with that.

00:41:50.661 --> 00:41:53.530
No. No,
you know nothing about me.

00:41:53.564 --> 00:41:57.200
Well, clearly not as much as I should.

00:41:57.235 --> 00:41:59.269
There's a lot you don't know as well.

00:41:59.303 --> 00:42:03.307
My family's been here for 160 years.

00:42:03.341 --> 00:42:08.112
I've lived here my entire life.
I am this town.

00:42:08.146 --> 00:42:11.448
I helped build it and I bled for it.

00:42:12.717 --> 00:42:14.918
Have you ever loved anything like that?

00:42:16.721 --> 00:42:19.189
I have.

00:42:24.595 --> 00:42:27.864
You see, people here
don't always approve

00:42:27.898 --> 00:42:29.565
of the way I go about things.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.635
But from what I've
seen since you got here,

00:42:32.669 --> 00:42:34.804
you're not very different
from me in that regard.

00:42:34.838 --> 00:42:39.140
So what puzzles me is why you
seem to hold me in such contempt.

00:42:41.477 --> 00:42:45.447
I have no contempt for you.

00:42:45.481 --> 00:42:50.786
I'm just not afraid of you.
I think maybe you're not used to that.

00:42:51.854 --> 00:42:54.990
See, you call yourself a businessman

00:42:55.025 --> 00:42:57.359
and you dress well, you speak well,

00:42:57.394 --> 00:43:00.429
but you're still
nothing but a petty thug.

00:43:00.464 --> 00:43:03.600
You've been doing it so long,
you actually think it makes sense

00:43:03.634 --> 00:43:05.601
to show up here in
the middle of the night

00:43:05.636 --> 00:43:09.139
and ask me why you can't own
me like you own everyone else.

00:43:10.174 --> 00:43:17.147
That makes you delusional,
which makes you dangerous.

00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:20.550
Why would I want to get
in bed with someone like that?

00:43:23.087 --> 00:43:28.158
Sheriff, do you know
why they're afraid of me?

00:43:28.192 --> 00:43:30.961
Why is that?

00:43:32.196 --> 00:43:34.931
Because they should be.

00:43:39.905 --> 00:43:42.274
And maybe you should be, too.

00:43:42.308 --> 00:43:47.312
Why don't you show me why right now?

00:43:51.117 --> 00:43:56.521
Nah.
I haven't given up on you just yet.

00:44:00.993 --> 00:44:03.528
You have a good night.

00:44:07.733 --> 00:44:10.568
<i>You're not
understanding me. He's done.</i>

00:44:10.603 --> 00:44:14.005
He's done permanently!

00:44:14.039 --> 00:44:17.241
The Sheriff fucked him up really bad.

00:44:17.276 --> 00:44:20.578
I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't seen it myself.

00:44:21.814 --> 00:44:24.449
No, look, look.
They already arrested him.

00:44:24.484 --> 00:44:26.051
I'm cutting my fuckin' losses.

00:44:26.085 --> 00:44:28.754
I never should've come
to this jerkwater town.

00:44:28.788 --> 00:44:30.155
I gotta call you back.

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.858
- Mr. Dern.
- I'm a little busy here.

00:44:32.926 --> 00:44:34.927
I imagine so.
I won't waste your time.

00:44:34.961 --> 00:44:39.198
- I'm here to pick up the satchel.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

00:44:40.467 --> 00:44:42.000
You were paid an
agreed-upon sum of cash

00:44:42.035 --> 00:44:43.935
to deliver the fight to the Kinaho Moon.

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:47.505
Clearly, the fight is off.
And while Mr. Proctor does not hold

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:51.709
Mr. Sanchez's reckless
behavior against you personally,

00:44:51.743 --> 00:44:54.712
he does expect his money
to be returned.

00:44:59.484 --> 00:45:02.752
Well, listen to me, little man.

00:45:02.787 --> 00:45:05.254
Proctor assured me that
he'd buy us enough time

00:45:05.289 --> 00:45:08.625
to pay off that little skank, so
he's the one that didn't come through.

00:45:08.659 --> 00:45:12.495
And as far as the money, tell him
it's the cost of doing business.

00:45:12.529 --> 00:45:16.799
And if he knows what's good
for him, he'll leave it at that.

00:45:16.834 --> 00:45:18.401
Now I'm gonna go finish packing...

00:45:18.435 --> 00:45:21.871
so I can get the fuck out
of this shithole!

00:45:45.796 --> 00:45:47.597
<i>Hey, what are
you doing here, asshole?</i>

00:45:47.631 --> 00:45:51.000
<i>I told you...
what the fuck is that?</i>

00:45:51.034 --> 00:45:53.669
<i>Hey, wait. Now, now, don't.
Come on. Just back off.</i>

00:45:53.703 --> 00:45:56.639
<i>Hey...</i>

00:45:56.673 --> 00:46:00.976
<i>Don't!</i>
