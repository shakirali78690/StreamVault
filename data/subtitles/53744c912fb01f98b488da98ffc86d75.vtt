<i>Okay, let's figure out
where we are.</i>

00:09:59.141 --> 00:10:01.643
We evacuated
the "Resolute" halfway between

00:10:01.727 --> 00:10:03.729
home and the colony--
Just call it Earth.

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:06.064
It's not your home anymore.

00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:08.776
Earth and the colony.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.361
This planet is unlike
any we have ever mapped.

00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:13.197
Wherever we are, I--

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.323
It's a Goldilocks planet.

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:15.699
Earth-like atmosphere,

00:10:15.783 --> 00:10:17.242
air pressure, gravity,

00:10:17.326 --> 00:10:19.244
clearly no lack of water.

00:10:19.328 --> 00:10:20.662
It's...

00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:23.624
The odds of
that happening are...

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:25.250
It's--it's like
winning the lottery.

00:10:25.334 --> 00:10:26.710
Why not dying in
a car accident?

00:10:26.794 --> 00:10:28.212
It's like winning the lottery.

00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:30.964
Till you remember you're
in a car accident.

00:10:31.048 --> 00:10:33.425
We're lost.
No kidding.

00:10:37.054 --> 00:10:40.933
I can't raise any
of the other Jupiters.

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:43.393
"Resolute" will send
a rescue party. Right?

00:10:43.477 --> 00:10:46.355
I'm sure they'll follow
emergency protocol.

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:48.106
Hey, where does it hurt?

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.691
All across here.

00:10:49.775 --> 00:10:51.693
It's from the crash harness.
It's normal.

00:10:51.777 --> 00:10:53.362
To you, maybe, not to him.

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:54.696
He didn't
mean anything by it.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.031
Yeah, maybe he just forgot

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:57.115
we're not under his command.

00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.743
It's okay.

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:01.995
Here, ready?

00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:03.664
Inhale.
[inhales]

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:05.374

00:11:09.253 --> 00:11:10.796
[all gasp]

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:15.717
Is that another crashed ship?

00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:17.970
You're disappointing me.
Look at the color.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:19.388
It's bright white...

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:21.181
If it was rocket fuel,
it would be reddish.

00:11:21.265 --> 00:11:22.933
Right.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:25.060
Okay, hint.
It's not a chemistry question.

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:26.395
It's a geology question.

00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:29.314
[distant rumbling]

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.193
Once that water freezes
the "Jupiter's"

00:11:33.277 --> 00:11:36.321
gonna be locked in
50 feet of solid ice.

00:11:36.405 --> 00:11:38.365
How long do we have?
A while.

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:41.326
How long is a while?
It depends...

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.037
on hull thermodynamics,
water salinity,

00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:45.163
how much displacement
there is.

00:11:45.247 --> 00:11:46.331
It's complicated.

00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:48.166
Does it matter?
You tell me.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:52.045
I know you've already done
the calculations.

00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:53.297
We should talk about
this privately.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.091
Do you two mind
letting us in on this?

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.343
<i>[soft dramatic music]</i>

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:06.226
In six hours,
the sun's gonna go down

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.230
and indications are it will
drop to 60 degrees below 0.

00:12:10.314 --> 00:12:12.190
At which point
our power cells will die--

00:12:12.274 --> 00:12:14.943
And so will we.

00:12:15.027 --> 00:12:16.695
We can't go anywhere
because of your leg.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.196
I am still figuring it out.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.115
What if you can't?
Then you leave me here.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.451
You descend the glacier and
it'll be warmer down there.

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:23.702
Mom, stop.
No, Mom.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:27.664
There's another way.

00:12:27.748 --> 00:12:28.957
We go back down.

00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:30.042
Get one of
the big ion lithiums

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:31.209
to recharge the suits.

00:12:31.293 --> 00:12:32.461
Not with that
tear in your suit.

00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:34.463
Airlock's too far.
You'll be dead in minutes.

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:39.384
It's closer.

00:12:43.055 --> 00:12:44.264
It'll only be a quick trip
in and out.

00:12:44.348 --> 00:12:46.224
He's the only one who'll fit.

00:12:46.308 --> 00:12:47.684
No, absolutely not.

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:50.020
He did the same training,
passed the same tests.

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:51.229
You can't train for this.

00:12:51.313 --> 00:12:53.440
Actually, you can.
And he did.

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:54.524
Will.
John!

00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:56.360
Come with me.
Come on.

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.153
John!

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.364
You're okay.
You got to listen to me.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.282
All you have to do
is go back in

00:13:02.366 --> 00:13:05.452

Supplies room's right there.

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.204
