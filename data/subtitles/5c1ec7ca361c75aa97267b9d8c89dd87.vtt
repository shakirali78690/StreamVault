00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:31.862
Fuck me.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.402
Hi, Job.

00:02:40.436 --> 00:02:43.904
- <i>You're out.</i>
- I'm out.

00:02:46.074 --> 00:02:48.175
Listen, I know why you're here,

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.877
but I cannot help you.

00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:52.012
Hey!

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:56.414
Just give me the address, Job.

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.613
Why are you even
assuming I know how to--

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.710
no, no, no, no!
Motherfucker!

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.457
Quit breaking my shit.

00:03:07.491 --> 00:03:09.530
Baby, you know how this works.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:13.870
The trail is cold.

00:03:13.904 --> 00:03:18.325
Okay, okay, okay!
Just... stop the carnage.

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.048
You've got the whole world
in front of you

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:37.789
and you're going
to the one place

00:03:37.823 --> 00:03:39.966
you absolutely should not go.

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:15.446
<i>What, are you crazy?!</i>

00:06:00.436 --> 00:06:02.187
Hey!

00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:29.396
<i>Morning, everyone.</i>

00:08:31.054 --> 00:08:34.930
I've reviewed the defense's
motion to dismiss.

00:08:34.964 --> 00:08:38.452
And based on the evidence,
or the lack thereof,

00:08:38.487 --> 00:08:40.148
it's my opinion
that the prosecution

00:08:40.183 --> 00:08:42.448
- cannot sustain the burden for a trial...
- Are you kidding me?

00:08:42.483 --> 00:08:43.747
- Your Honor--
- <i>...so I'm finding for the defense.</i>

00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:46.049
<i>Case dismissed.</i>

00:08:48.055 --> 00:08:51.460
<i>You can't take this</i>
<i>to trial, Gordon.</i>

00:08:51.494 --> 00:08:53.366
You should be thanking me

00:08:53.401 --> 00:08:55.342
for saving you
the embarrassment.

00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:15.360
- Gordon.
- Jackson.

00:09:15.395 --> 00:09:18.397
That a judge in your pocket
or you just happy to see me?

00:09:24.403 --> 00:09:26.170
Mr. Mayor.

00:09:32.924 --> 00:09:36.693
- Jesus Christ, Gordon.
- Oh, pace yourself, Dan.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.930
Our day will come.

00:09:40.965 --> 00:09:44.967
Guys like Kai Proctor
don't go down easy.

00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:54.574
<i>Carrie.</i>

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.244
Hey.

00:10:00.147 --> 00:10:02.781
You'll get him
next time, Counselor.

00:10:02.815 --> 00:10:05.816
Yeah, I am ready
for this day to be over.

00:10:07.151 --> 00:10:09.686
Again?

00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:11.821
Yeah.

00:10:13.156 --> 00:10:14.757
<i>It's nothing
to freak out about.</i>

00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:16.925
<i>We're not freaking out.
We're just talking to you.</i>

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:19.961
My point is we don't solve
our problems with violence.

00:10:19.996 --> 00:10:21.796
I just completed another level.

00:10:21.831 --> 00:10:23.864
Yeah, it happens
every day, Dad.

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:26.032
I just can't believe that
you kicked your teacher.

00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:28.601
- Substitute teacher.
- Oh, well, it's okay, then.

00:10:28.635 --> 00:10:30.902
He's a perv, Mom.
He tried to see down my shirt.

00:10:30.936 --> 00:10:33.171
Well, with a shirt like that,
it doesn't take much trying.

00:10:33.206 --> 00:10:34.872
- So it's my fault?
- Gordon.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.173
So if I get molested
by a teacher,

00:10:36.208 --> 00:10:37.708
- you'll just blame it on my shirt?
- No, no. Go.

00:10:37.742 --> 00:10:40.176
- Deva, come on.
- Okay, all right.

00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:43.980
Max, honey, you have your inhaler?

00:10:46.383 --> 00:10:48.884
Dr. Welling referred Max
to another pulmonologist.

00:10:48.918 --> 00:10:50.551
We have an appointment
next week.

00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:53.455
Okay. Great.

00:10:53.489 --> 00:10:57.057
- Is your shoulder bad today?
- Ah, it's just the usual.

00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:59.025
It'll be all right.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.593
I think I might grab a shower.

00:11:00.627 --> 00:11:02.360
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:11:16.264 --> 00:11:20.198
That's Beaty. Later.

00:11:50.006 --> 00:11:52.974
- You're late, bitch.
- Whatever, skank.

00:11:53.009 --> 00:11:54.909
<i>So, are you in shit</i>
<i>with your parents?</i>

00:11:54.943 --> 00:11:57.177
Yeah, when am I not?

00:12:35.787 --> 00:12:37.388
Howdy.

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:43.996
I'm gonna go with shitty day

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.564
and whiskey neat.

00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:47.700
Whiskey's fine.

00:12:54.206 --> 00:12:55.873
And one for yourself.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.817
Are you coming or going?

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:09.721
I'm still working that out.

00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:18.360
That's me, Sugar Bates

00:13:18.394 --> 00:13:20.660
<i>in the cruiserweight years.</i>

00:13:20.695 --> 00:13:22.929
When'd you drop him?

00:13:22.964 --> 00:13:24.898
Fifth?

00:13:24.932 --> 00:13:26.599
Eighth.

00:13:26.634 --> 00:13:31.036
He was a southpaw.
They take longer.

00:13:31.104 --> 00:13:33.205
See, it was a title fight.

00:13:33.239 --> 00:13:35.473
I held the belt for 18 months.

00:13:35.508 --> 00:13:38.609
I used to hang it
right up there.

00:13:38.644 --> 00:13:39.877
<i>You know?</i>

00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:42.213
<i>A good conversation piece.</i>

00:13:42.247 --> 00:13:44.548
But with this tough
economy, I had to pawn it

00:13:44.583 --> 00:13:48.385
a little while back
to pay for the leaking taps.

00:13:50.555 --> 00:13:52.089
That's a shame.

00:13:52.124 --> 00:13:54.659
Where are you from?

00:13:57.262 --> 00:13:59.129
Different places.

00:14:05.669 --> 00:14:07.769
Where'd you sit?

00:14:12.475 --> 00:14:13.942
Roscoe.

00:14:15.077 --> 00:14:17.545
I did eight years at Allenwood.

00:14:20.315 --> 00:14:22.483
You look fresh.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.521
Freedom.

00:14:29.892 --> 00:14:31.492
Freedom.

00:14:46.105 --> 00:14:48.573
Always this quiet around here?

00:14:50.542 --> 00:14:53.745
Well, let's stimulate
the local economy.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.681
Next round's on me.

00:14:55.715 --> 00:14:57.148
All right.

00:14:57.183 --> 00:15:01.120
All you tourists
buying me drinks today.

00:15:01.154 --> 00:15:03.522
I'm not a tourist.

00:15:05.793 --> 00:15:07.528
My name is Lucas Hood.

00:15:07.562 --> 00:15:11.770
And come Monday, I'm being
sworn in as the new sheriff.

00:15:11.804 --> 00:15:13.973
Congratulations.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.210
<i>Or should we say good luck?</i>

00:15:17.278 --> 00:15:19.379
<i>I'll take both, thanks.</i>

00:15:19.414 --> 00:15:21.449
<i>I spent nine years as sheriff</i>
<i>up in Church, Oregon.</i>

00:15:21.483 --> 00:15:23.718
You ever heard of it?

00:15:23.752 --> 00:15:27.289
<i>Yeah, I'm not surprised.</i>
<i>It's the armpit of the West.</i>

00:15:27.323 --> 00:15:29.124
<i>This is my first day east.</i>

00:15:29.158 --> 00:15:31.459
I just drove clear
across the country.

00:15:31.493 --> 00:15:33.428
There's less to see
than you'd think.

00:15:33.462 --> 00:15:37.470
I thought the sheriff
had to be elected.

00:15:37.504 --> 00:15:39.341
<i>Usually, but under</i>
<i>certain circumstances,</i>

00:15:39.375 --> 00:15:41.209
<i>the mayor can</i>
<i>bring in a ringer.</i>

00:15:41.244 --> 00:15:44.145
<i>He and Sheriff Morgan</i>
<i>are the ones who hired me, so...</i>

00:15:44.179 --> 00:15:46.281
I was looking forward to
meeting them when I got here.

00:15:46.315 --> 00:15:48.184
<i>Yeah, well,
that'd be quite a trick</i>

00:15:48.218 --> 00:15:50.252
since he died last Tuesday.

00:15:50.286 --> 00:15:52.187
Liver cancer.

00:15:53.322 --> 00:15:55.457
I think he thought
he had more time.

00:15:58.528 --> 00:16:00.528
<i>Aw, shit.</i>

00:16:03.965 --> 00:16:06.199
<i>Your boss know you're here?</i>

00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:10.267
Don't worry about him.
You know the drill.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.173
Look at this guy.

00:16:23.277 --> 00:16:25.144
Excuse me.

00:16:25.178 --> 00:16:27.045
Are we disturbing you?

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.480
No, not at all.

00:16:28.514 --> 00:16:30.916
This is just a very good steak.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.084
<i>And I know that once I stand
up to deal with you fellas--</i>

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:36.887
<i>well, maybe you'll come quietly
or maybe I'll have to kill you--</i>

00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:38.922
<i>but either way, this steak</i>
<i>is gonna get cold.</i>

00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:40.424
<i>And you can always</i>
<i>reheat a steak,</i>

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:42.793
but it's never quite the same.

00:16:42.827 --> 00:16:44.994
Hmm?

00:16:45.029 --> 00:16:51.000
You got some balls on
you, motherfucker.

00:16:56.639 --> 00:16:59.139
Sheriff's Department.
I'll take that gun now.

00:16:59.174 --> 00:17:01.141
<i>No, you drop your fucking gun.</i>

00:17:10.584 --> 00:17:13.085
That's the new STI, isn't it?

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:15.354
- That's a hard gun to get.
- Who the fuck is this guy?

00:17:15.388 --> 00:17:18.359
- You sit your ass down.
- All right, hear me out, Sheriff.

00:17:18.394 --> 00:17:20.729
- They got you outgunned.
- Damn straight we do.

00:17:20.764 --> 00:17:22.698
While on the other hand,
if he shoots,

00:17:22.732 --> 00:17:24.566
one of you boys is dead

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.668
or shitting in a bag
the rest of his life.

00:17:26.702 --> 00:17:27.669
For what?

00:17:27.703 --> 00:17:29.504
The 200 bucks
Sugar has in the register

00:17:29.538 --> 00:17:31.172
<i>at 4:00 p.m.</i>
<i>on a Tuesday? Come on.</i>

00:17:31.207 --> 00:17:34.509
So, Sheriff, why don't you
let them take the cash?

00:17:34.543 --> 00:17:36.110
Just let them take it.

00:17:36.145 --> 00:17:37.945
I'll buy enough drinks
to make him whole.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.148
Everyone goes home happy.
What do you say?

00:17:42.584 --> 00:17:44.417
<i>Come on.</i>

00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:50.423
Ah!

00:17:50.457 --> 00:17:52.557
Oh, God!

00:18:27.555 --> 00:18:29.689
<i>Am I dead?</i>

00:18:31.058 --> 00:18:32.458
Yeah.

00:18:32.492 --> 00:18:35.262
It's my first day in town.

00:18:35.296 --> 00:18:38.098
Shit!

00:18:39.934 --> 00:18:42.035
Sorry.

00:18:42.069 --> 00:18:46.738
I hope my mother
was right about God.

00:18:52.277 --> 00:18:55.245
Jesus ripshit Christ.

00:18:58.882 --> 00:19:01.250
This is what you call
in the Bible

00:19:01.284 --> 00:19:04.620
a "clusterfuck
of epic proportions."

00:19:06.489 --> 00:19:11.160
Two cons, three corpses,
one of them a cop.

00:19:11.194 --> 00:19:13.529
I don't like that math.

00:19:14.864 --> 00:19:17.633
<i>You'd better get out of here.</i>

00:19:22.637 --> 00:19:25.372
Well, they would have
killed me same as him.

00:19:25.406 --> 00:19:29.410
The least I can do
is give you a head start.

00:19:29.444 --> 00:19:31.013
What about you?

00:19:31.048 --> 00:19:33.516
<i>I got a few tricks.</i>

00:19:34.584 --> 00:19:36.652
<i>Go on, now.</i>
<i>Get out of here.</i>

00:20:04.915 --> 00:20:06.517
Hi, Ana.

00:20:11.658 --> 00:20:13.591
How did you find me?

00:20:16.261 --> 00:20:19.263
It was Job.

00:20:20.632 --> 00:20:22.767
It's a nice house.

00:20:25.103 --> 00:20:27.771
Yeah. It seems, um...

00:20:28.806 --> 00:20:31.273
<i>uh, solid.</i>

00:20:31.308 --> 00:20:33.776
So, what do you have, two kids?

00:20:35.745 --> 00:20:38.546
- Yes.
- Yeah?

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.080
How old?

00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:42.949
My son is eight.

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:47.653
My daughter is 13.

00:20:47.687 --> 00:20:49.821
Hmm.

00:20:51.123 --> 00:20:52.957
She looks older.

00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:03.798
I can smell
your perfume from here.

00:21:05.268 --> 00:21:08.536
Please, you're gonna
have to leave.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.638
Please. Please.

00:21:12.507 --> 00:21:14.206
Ana.

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:16.442
I'm not Ana anymore.

00:21:16.476 --> 00:21:18.310
My name is Carrie.

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:24.015
Where were you?

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:26.417
- I tried to visit.
- No. 15 years.

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:28.719
- I drove up to those gates.
- You were here playing fucking house?

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:30.154
You have no idea
how many times.

00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:32.289
Don't you tell me that.
Where the fuck were you?!

00:21:32.323 --> 00:21:35.057
I don't have to
justify myself to you.

00:21:35.125 --> 00:21:37.360
I have responsibilities.

00:21:37.394 --> 00:21:39.495
I have children.

00:21:40.997 --> 00:21:42.931
Okay?

00:21:44.233 --> 00:21:49.003
I have a husband who loves me.

00:21:49.872 --> 00:21:51.672
No.

00:21:55.711 --> 00:21:59.114
- It's me.
- Don't. I can't.

00:22:02.017 --> 00:22:04.418
You could have led Rabbit
straight to me.

00:22:04.453 --> 00:22:07.520
What the fuck
were you thinking?

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.828
Okay.

00:22:17.697 --> 00:22:20.399
You moved on.
I get it.

00:22:23.235 --> 00:22:26.771
So give me my cut and
you'll never see me again.

00:22:29.241 --> 00:22:31.142
I don't have the diamonds.

00:22:31.176 --> 00:22:33.577
What? What?

00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:35.212
<i>After we screwed</i>
<i>Rabbit like that</i>

00:22:35.246 --> 00:22:37.848
- <i>and you had gotten caught--</i>
- No, no, I did not get caught!

00:22:37.882 --> 00:22:39.649
- There were two of us there that night!
- Shh, shh!

00:22:39.717 --> 00:22:42.652
- I led them away from you!
- I know.

00:22:42.686 --> 00:22:45.321
Listen, I tried to fence them.

00:22:45.355 --> 00:22:50.325
The guys I found, these real
bottom-feeders-- Serbians...

00:22:53.662 --> 00:22:55.296
they saw me coming.

00:22:57.799 --> 00:23:00.367
You're telling me
you got rolled?

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:05.572
Does it look like
I'm sitting on $10 million?

00:23:16.682 --> 00:23:18.916
Mm.

00:23:22.654 --> 00:23:25.189
I don't get the girl.

00:23:25.256 --> 00:23:27.424
I don't get the money.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.396
I spent 15 years
picturing this day,

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:36.833
and I gotta tell you, this is
not how I saw it playing out.

00:23:36.867 --> 00:23:40.536
I'm so sorry.
I am so fucking sorry.

00:23:41.838 --> 00:23:45.140
<i>- Hey, babe, you out here?</i>
- Shit.

00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:49.376
Yeah.
Hey, honey.

00:23:49.411 --> 00:23:51.277
Raccoon.

00:24:09.862 --> 00:24:11.729
Christ.

00:24:11.764 --> 00:24:13.164
You trying to kill me?

00:24:13.198 --> 00:24:15.866
Have you picked a spot yet?

00:24:18.569 --> 00:24:20.070
Ha.

00:24:20.104 --> 00:24:22.538
You one of them
complicated types.

00:24:22.573 --> 00:24:24.674
Is that it?

00:24:28.378 --> 00:24:31.480
Nah, some people just don't
know simple when they see it.

00:24:32.849 --> 00:24:34.917
Sh...

00:24:46.397 --> 00:24:49.165
Don't seem right

00:24:49.199 --> 00:24:52.234
burying the sheriff
with that pond scum.

00:24:52.268 --> 00:24:54.769
What, do you wanna
dig him his own hole?

00:24:54.804 --> 00:24:57.739
Yeah, that'd be
the Christian thing to do.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.244
That you?
- No.

00:25:33.673 --> 00:25:36.272
- Hello?
- <i>Sheriff Hood, it's Mayor Dan Kendall.</i>

00:25:36.307 --> 00:25:38.539
<i>Am I catching you</i>
<i>at a bad time?</i>

00:25:43.146 --> 00:25:44.979
<i>Sheriff?</i>

00:25:45.014 --> 00:25:47.081
<i>Are you there?</i>

00:25:52.187 --> 00:25:54.955
- Yeah, this is Hood.
- <i>How's the drive going?</i>

00:25:59.191 --> 00:26:00.925
A lot less to see
than you'd think.

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:02.726
<i>Well, I just wanted</i>
<i>to confirm tomorrow.</i>

00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:05.730
<i>You'll be in town by then?</i>

00:26:05.764 --> 00:26:07.331
- Should be, yeah.
- <i>Great.</i>

00:26:07.364 --> 00:26:10.266
<i>So that's 1:00</i>
<i>at Miles' Diner.</i>

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.367
<i>I look forward to finally</i>
<i>meeting you in person.</i>

00:26:12.402 --> 00:26:15.801
Great.
I'll see you then.

00:26:17.202 --> 00:26:20.870
Now tell me you got some
kind of master plan here.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:31.680
Well, I usually just
get by with my charm.

00:26:40.688 --> 00:26:43.055
- Hishi Salon.
<i>- I need a favor.</i>

00:26:43.089 --> 00:26:45.524
And I need $5,000
for all the shit you broke.

00:26:45.558 --> 00:26:48.660
- I'll make it 10.
- <i>Fuck you!</i>

00:26:48.695 --> 00:26:50.695
Speak.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.764
I need to become someone else.

00:26:52.798 --> 00:26:54.465
Honey child, don't we all?

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.799
<i>Someone specific.</i>

00:26:58.335 --> 00:26:59.801
Name?

00:26:59.836 --> 00:27:01.436
Lucas Hood

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:02.971
<i>of Church, Oregon.</i>

00:27:03.038 --> 00:27:05.105
Shouldn't be a problem.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.373
Unless he's
a motherfuckin' cop.

00:27:07.408 --> 00:27:08.441
Are you kidding me?

00:27:08.475 --> 00:27:10.042
I need it quick, Job.

00:27:10.076 --> 00:27:12.077
<i>Baby, you just sat for 15 years</i>

00:27:12.111 --> 00:27:14.779
because you were the most
notorious thief in the country.

00:27:14.814 --> 00:27:16.747
Now you want to play cop?

00:27:16.782 --> 00:27:19.983
- Can you do it? - <i>I mean, I have to hack</i>
<i>law enforcement databases,</i>

00:27:20.018 --> 00:27:21.918
<i>swap out fingerprints</i>
<i>and photo IDs,</i>

00:27:21.953 --> 00:27:25.221
- <i>find any news article that might</i>
<i>have run a picture--</i> - So you can't do it?

00:27:25.256 --> 00:27:28.290
Suck my tit, bitch!
Of course I can do it.

00:27:29.592 --> 00:27:31.259
Take a couple days.

00:27:31.294 --> 00:27:34.062
As for the credentials, I can get you
the papers, but the badge itself--

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:35.830
I got the badge.

00:27:35.864 --> 00:27:38.199
<i>I don't even wanna know.</i>

00:27:40.369 --> 00:27:43.270
You know, some cons,
the minute they get out,

00:27:43.304 --> 00:27:45.638
they're just trying
like hell to get back in.

00:27:45.673 --> 00:27:48.141
I'm not going back.

00:27:48.175 --> 00:27:50.410
Yeah, well, you got
a revolutionary way

00:27:50.444 --> 00:27:52.745
of staying out of trouble.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.446
Here.

00:27:54.481 --> 00:27:57.182
The pickup belonged
to the sheriff.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.587
Thanks.

00:28:07.425 --> 00:28:09.692
Hey.

00:28:11.128 --> 00:28:13.496
You got a place to stay?

00:28:58.436 --> 00:29:00.569
No one's ever stolen
from Rabbit.

00:29:52.748 --> 00:29:54.550
Okay.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:01.025
Hey, go in back
and stay out of sight.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.795
- What for?
- Go now.

00:30:16.478 --> 00:30:18.612
Morning, Sugar.

00:30:18.647 --> 00:30:20.982
Kai.

00:30:32.125 --> 00:30:34.393
How are the headaches?

00:30:34.428 --> 00:30:36.995
Did those Mexican
painkillers I got you help?

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.132
They did.
Thanks.

00:30:43.202 --> 00:30:46.537
What brings you around?

00:30:46.571 --> 00:30:48.939
I seem to have misplaced
two of my men--

00:30:48.973 --> 00:30:51.641
Randall and Munson.

00:30:51.709 --> 00:30:54.610
Munson, the bald one?

00:30:54.645 --> 00:30:56.513
<i>One of the boys thought</i>
<i>they might have been</i>

00:30:56.547 --> 00:30:58.382
<i>headed out this way</i>
<i>yesterday afternoon.</i>

00:30:58.416 --> 00:31:00.317
Well, they didn't come here.

00:31:00.351 --> 00:31:02.552
If they did,
I'd have taken notice.

00:31:04.021 --> 00:31:06.823
If any of my employees
ever stepped out of line,

00:31:06.858 --> 00:31:09.926
hassled you in any way,
I'd expect you to call me.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.963
<i>What I mean is I wouldn't want you to
take matters into your own hands.</i>

00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:16.732
Look at me.

00:31:16.766 --> 00:31:20.569
Nobody runs from a fight
faster than an old fighter.

00:31:24.072 --> 00:31:26.874
<i>What happened</i>
<i>to your title fight?</i>

00:31:26.908 --> 00:31:29.242
Oh, I knocked it
off the hook the other night,

00:31:29.276 --> 00:31:30.977
busted up the frame.

00:31:31.011 --> 00:31:32.778
I'm having it redone.

00:31:40.752 --> 00:31:43.053
- Thanks for the drink.
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

00:31:43.087 --> 00:31:46.222
You let me know if you need
any more of those painkillers.

00:32:16.511 --> 00:32:18.312
That's some car.

00:32:18.346 --> 00:32:21.615
Look, if you're thinking of
stealing from Kai Proctor,

00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:24.717
you may as well take a bullet and
put it in your head right now.

00:32:24.752 --> 00:32:28.087
Kai Proctor.
There is a name.

00:32:28.121 --> 00:32:30.586
<i>What the man</i>
<i>doesn't own, he runs.</i>

00:32:30.621 --> 00:32:35.447
What he doesn't run,
he burns to the ground.

00:32:35.482 --> 00:32:38.382
<i>He seemed to like you</i>
<i>well enough.</i>

00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:42.919
We go back a ways.

00:32:42.954 --> 00:32:46.022
- Uh-huh.
- <i>Listen.</i>

00:32:46.057 --> 00:32:49.492
<i>You don't seem like the kind
of guy who takes advice...</i>

00:32:51.528 --> 00:32:54.430
but I'm gonna try anyway.

00:32:57.667 --> 00:33:00.969
There's $400.
Take it and go.

00:33:02.071 --> 00:33:04.805
- I can't.
- Look around.

00:33:04.839 --> 00:33:07.641
- You're free, man.
- No.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.678
Pay you back in a few days.

00:34:31.465 --> 00:34:34.066
Good to meet you.
Lucas Hood.

00:34:36.002 --> 00:34:38.703
Lucas Hood.
How are-- how--

00:35:00.957 --> 00:35:03.191
Excuse me.

00:35:03.225 --> 00:35:04.892
- Say hi to Amy.
- Thank you.

00:35:04.926 --> 00:35:09.095
- Sheriff Hood?
- That's right.

00:35:09.129 --> 00:35:11.096
It's great to meet you.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.997
Yeah, you, too.

00:35:14.032 --> 00:35:15.766
I know, I look young,

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.701
but that's just because I am.

00:35:18.803 --> 00:35:20.770
Have a seat.

00:35:38.445 --> 00:35:42.074
Job, two suits, badly tailored.

00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:44.209
They're looking for you.

00:35:45.277 --> 00:35:46.877
Cops?

00:35:48.212 --> 00:35:50.211
Let's hope so.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.680
I want all the backup
drives in the car now.

00:36:09.521 --> 00:36:12.020
Keep the engine running.

00:36:21.855 --> 00:36:25.188
Gentlemen, we don't
actually open till 10:00,

00:36:25.222 --> 00:36:26.922
but if you'll follow me
back upstairs,

00:36:26.956 --> 00:36:29.291
I'm sure we can find
somewhere to fit you in.

00:36:29.325 --> 00:36:33.500
Down here might be better for the
private nature of our inquiry.

00:36:33.534 --> 00:36:36.435
Inquiry? Hmm.

00:36:36.469 --> 00:36:38.569
May I see some ID?

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.872
This ain't a badge.

00:36:49.906 --> 00:36:53.240
No... it's not.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:03.243
Fucking slope cunt!

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:08.310
We work for Mr. Rabbit.

00:37:12.046 --> 00:37:13.546
Sweet fuck.

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.949
The guy you're looking for
came in a couple of days ago.

00:37:16.984 --> 00:37:18.551
And what did he want?

00:37:18.585 --> 00:37:22.420
Just the usual, man--
credit cards, IDs.

00:37:22.454 --> 00:37:25.657
- Where is he now?
- I'll tell Mr. Rabbit whatever he wants,

00:37:25.692 --> 00:37:28.030
but I've no idea.

00:37:30.268 --> 00:37:32.068
O-Okay, okay, okay!

00:37:32.135 --> 00:37:34.235
I'll get the file!
It's in the safe.

00:37:38.936 --> 00:37:41.669
That would be helpful.

So I pissed off some
people when I hired you.

00:38:14.177 --> 00:38:15.477
But every sheriff
that we've had,

00:38:15.511 --> 00:38:16.844
including Morgan,

00:38:16.878 --> 00:38:18.644
ended up on Proctor's payroll,

00:38:18.679 --> 00:38:20.311
so I needed an outsider.

00:38:21.812 --> 00:38:24.072
So you brought me in here
to take down this one guy?

00:38:24.107 --> 00:38:25.895
This Proctor?

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.588
He's not just one guy,
all right?

00:38:28.622 --> 00:38:30.351
There's not a criminal
enterprise around here

00:38:30.385 --> 00:38:32.749
that doesn't start
or end in his pockets.

00:38:33.947 --> 00:38:36.811
Now, I know you don't
work till Monday,

00:38:36.843 --> 00:38:40.072
but I wanna show you the Cadi.

00:38:40.107 --> 00:38:41.705
The Cadi?

00:38:44.369 --> 00:38:46.433
The old Sheriff's Department
burned down three years ago.

00:38:46.467 --> 00:38:47.997
City Hall was pretty strapped.

00:38:48.031 --> 00:38:50.562
Froemer's Cadillac had just
gone under, so we got creative.

00:38:50.597 --> 00:38:52.693
<i>Girl, you're
gonna leave that man</i>

00:38:52.728 --> 00:38:54.189
and you're gonna
leave that man tonight.

00:38:54.223 --> 00:38:55.919
- Mm-mm.
- Alma.

00:38:55.953 --> 00:38:58.950
Um, I'll call you later.

00:38:58.984 --> 00:39:00.848
Meet Lucas Hood.

00:39:00.882 --> 00:39:02.980
- Good to meet you, Alma.
- Sheriff Hood.

00:39:03.014 --> 00:39:05.045
Great to meet you.

00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:08.110
Mm-hmm.

00:39:08.644 --> 00:39:12.540
- Afternoon, Mayor.
- This is Lucas Hood.

00:39:14.308 --> 00:39:15.905
<i>This is Emmett Yawners.</i>

00:39:15.939 --> 00:39:18.434
<i>He's one of the top 10 rushers
of all time at Penn State.</i>

00:39:18.469 --> 00:39:20.332
- Good to meet you.
- Welcome to the BSD.

00:39:20.367 --> 00:39:21.932
<i>And this is Brock Lotus,</i>

00:39:21.967 --> 00:39:23.597
<i>our longest-serving member</i>
<i>of the department.</i>

00:39:23.631 --> 00:39:25.029
That right?

00:39:25.064 --> 00:39:26.961
How are you doing, Sheriff?

00:39:26.995 --> 00:39:29.457
You fucking fascist!

00:39:29.492 --> 00:39:31.057
I didn't even do anything.

00:39:31.092 --> 00:39:33.821
Oh, yeah, you're
a model citizen.

00:39:35.256 --> 00:39:36.726
You try and fight me again,

00:39:36.761 --> 00:39:39.729
I remove your
fucking testicles.

00:39:39.763 --> 00:39:41.461
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:39:41.495 --> 00:39:43.960
<i>This is Lucas Hood.
It's your new boss.</i>

00:39:43.995 --> 00:39:46.725
Well, shit, Danny, you
could have said so sooner.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.025
I'm Siobhan Kelly.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.192
- My name's Peter.
- Shut the fuck up!

00:39:50.226 --> 00:39:53.051
Siobhan, I was thinking maybe you could
show the sheriff the town of Banshee.

00:39:53.086 --> 00:39:56.378
Oh, I'd love to, but I have to
write up Charlie Sheen over here.

00:39:59.311 --> 00:40:01.244
Actually, I'd love a tour

00:40:01.278 --> 00:40:03.843
from the longest-serving
member of the department.

00:40:05.309 --> 00:40:07.608
All right, so why don't we start
on the outskirts of town?

00:40:07.642 --> 00:40:10.507
There's an Indian casino.
Work our way back.

00:40:12.441 --> 00:40:14.506
Did I catch you on a bad day

00:40:14.541 --> 00:40:17.006
or you always this cheerful?

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.205
Aw, shit.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.837
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:40:21.872 --> 00:40:23.737
Moody boys build furniture

00:40:23.771 --> 00:40:25.936
and the Amish mills have been
driving down their prices.

00:40:25.971 --> 00:40:28.434
We've, uh--
we've had incidents.

00:40:31.434 --> 00:40:33.833
<i>They won't hit back.</i>

00:40:33.868 --> 00:40:36.233
Oh, you've seen "Witness."
Yeah, that's great.

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:37.798
Why don't you let me
handle this, huh?

00:40:37.833 --> 00:40:40.397
- Yeah, sure.
- Hood, Hood!

00:40:42.564 --> 00:40:45.263
<i>Whoops!</i>

00:40:48.462 --> 00:40:50.327
We don't--
we want no trouble.

00:40:51.828 --> 00:40:52.960
Hey!

00:40:55.162 --> 00:40:57.659
Why don't we all
just take a moment,

00:40:57.693 --> 00:40:59.491
talk about this?

00:40:59.526 --> 00:41:01.258
Who the fuck are you?

00:41:01.325 --> 00:41:04.622
Lucas Hood.
I'm the new sheriff.

00:41:04.657 --> 00:41:07.088
Hey, Lotus, I thought
you were supposed

00:41:07.123 --> 00:41:08.887
to take over
when Morgan kicked.

00:41:08.922 --> 00:41:11.486
Yeah, well, you and me both.

00:41:12.954 --> 00:41:14.718
Hey! Cole.

00:41:14.753 --> 00:41:17.218
That's enough.

00:41:17.253 --> 00:41:18.984
I'm sure your wife's
got better things to do

00:41:19.018 --> 00:41:20.549
than bail your ass
out of jail today.

00:41:20.584 --> 00:41:24.116
<i>- I'm not through messing with them.</i>
- Yeah, you are.

00:41:24.151 --> 00:41:27.748
If you're the sheriff,
why aren't you in uniform?

00:41:27.782 --> 00:41:29.714
I don't start till Monday.

00:41:29.748 --> 00:41:31.980
So there's nothing stopping us

00:41:32.014 --> 00:41:34.446
from fucking your shit up
today, then, huh?

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.479
Yeah. I hoped you'd
make that connection.

00:41:37.513 --> 00:41:41.545
- All right.
- Easy, Deputy. I got this.

00:41:42.545 --> 00:41:44.977
So, come on, Cole...

00:41:46.577 --> 00:41:48.408
fuck my shit up.

00:41:50.943 --> 00:41:52.908
All right, just to be clear,

00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:54.641
I'm gonna be pounding
a civilian--

00:41:58.474 --> 00:41:59.973
<i>Come on, motherfucker.</i>
<i>Get up!</i>

00:42:04.839 --> 00:42:07.603
<i>Get his ass, Cole.</i>
<i>Get his ass!</i>

00:42:10.105 --> 00:42:12.170
That's enough, Cole.

00:42:12.205 --> 00:42:15.036
Mr. Proctor.

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:20.202
Your four-on-one advantage
wasn't enough?

00:42:21.169 --> 00:42:23.976
You needed this?

00:42:27.191 --> 00:42:29.394
Come on, guys.

00:42:30.729 --> 00:42:33.064
Hold on.

00:42:33.098 --> 00:42:34.599
These men are on a schedule.

00:42:34.633 --> 00:42:38.136
Why don't you boys help
them load their wagons?

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:41.005
Yes, sir.
Come on.

00:42:48.213 --> 00:42:50.415
You are?

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:56.190
- Lucas Hood.
- The new sheriff.

00:42:57.459 --> 00:43:01.361
Fucking Dutchie.
This isn't over.

00:43:07.868 --> 00:43:09.735
Kai Proctor.

00:43:09.769 --> 00:43:12.404
Sorry if I stepped
on your toes there.

00:43:12.439 --> 00:43:16.675
- Mr. Proctor, what exactly do you do?
- I'm in meats.

00:43:19.545 --> 00:43:22.680
Why don't you stop by
the slaughterhouse?

00:43:22.714 --> 00:43:25.383
<i>I'll set you up</i>
<i>with some nice steaks.</i>

00:43:46.267 --> 00:43:48.403
_

00:43:50.962 --> 00:43:53.201
_

00:44:06.855 --> 00:44:10.257
Hey, Lotus, I'm gonna walk.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:18.397
You're welcome, by the way.

00:44:49.956 --> 00:44:51.857
<i>♪ Are you happy</i>
<i>with yourself? ♪</i>

00:44:51.891 --> 00:44:54.492
<i>♪ Are you happy with</i>
<i>yourself? ♪</i>

00:44:54.526 --> 00:44:57.461
<i>♪ I hope you're happy,</i>
<i>but I don't think so ♪</i>

00:44:57.495 --> 00:44:59.529
<i>♪ I don't think so, I don't ♪</i>

00:44:59.564 --> 00:45:03.099
- <i>♪ Are you happy with yourself? ♪</i>
- I-- I have to go.

00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:05.101
Come on, stay with me.

00:45:05.136 --> 00:45:07.670
- See you later.
- What?

00:45:10.574 --> 00:45:12.207
But I love you.

00:45:14.811 --> 00:45:16.812
- Whoa! You okay?
- Yeah, my bad.

00:45:16.846 --> 00:45:18.647
Okay.
It's all right.

00:45:23.784 --> 00:45:26.319
13 years old, my ass.

00:45:26.353 --> 00:45:29.855
Hey. Sorry,
you dropped this.

00:45:29.889 --> 00:45:32.789
- Thanks.
- Shouldn't you be in school?

00:45:32.824 --> 00:45:34.959
Yeah, I should.

00:45:34.994 --> 00:45:37.661
Can't your boyfriend
take you back?

00:45:37.696 --> 00:45:39.296
Who says he's my boyfriend?

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:40.896
Well, I hope he's not
your brother.

00:46:18.356 --> 00:46:20.357
P&Ls.

00:46:20.458 --> 00:46:22.859
Our numbers are down
at both strip clubs?

00:46:22.894 --> 00:46:26.296
With the economy what it is...

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:29.198
Men will pay for tits
until they're broke or dead.

00:46:29.232 --> 00:46:30.833
Fix that, Burton.

00:46:41.943 --> 00:46:44.344
You said you wanted to see me?

00:46:46.814 --> 00:46:48.781
It's a relatively
humane procedure.

00:46:48.816 --> 00:46:52.884
We stun the beasts with a
pneumatic captive bolt gun--

00:46:52.952 --> 00:46:54.519
one of these.

00:46:54.553 --> 00:46:57.655
One bolt to the brain
does the trick.

00:46:57.723 --> 00:47:01.558
Then we cut them
and they quietly bleed out.

00:47:01.593 --> 00:47:04.628
- Listen, um--
- The Old Order Pennsylvania Dutch

00:47:04.662 --> 00:47:06.496
don't like being
called "Dutchies."

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:07.897
It's derisive.

00:47:07.931 --> 00:47:11.566
I believe I heard you call my
father a "fucking Dutchie."

00:47:13.402 --> 00:47:16.037
I was just running my mouth.

00:47:16.071 --> 00:47:18.472
I-I didn't know
he was your father.

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.521
Now you take your teeth
and put them back

00:47:36.556 --> 00:47:39.325
in your fat, bigoted mouth
and get the fuck out of here.

00:47:39.359 --> 00:47:42.194
Back in your mouth, I said.

00:47:52.074 --> 00:47:54.877
Why don't you see
Mr. Moody out?

00:48:11.694 --> 00:48:13.395
You.

00:49:17.586 --> 00:49:20.422
- They get your size wrong?
- No, I'm good.

00:49:23.859 --> 00:49:25.593
Bring the pants to the
Martinizing over by the diner.

00:49:25.628 --> 00:49:27.095
They'll take them in for you.

00:49:27.129 --> 00:49:29.530
All right, thanks.
I'll do that.

00:49:31.465 --> 00:49:33.567
You got any family
coming to the swearing in?

00:49:33.601 --> 00:49:37.436
No, I don't have any family,

00:49:37.471 --> 00:49:39.842
coming or not.

00:49:40.946 --> 00:49:43.315
Well, we'll all be there

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:45.384
and at Proctor's
reception after.

00:49:45.418 --> 00:49:47.053
Reception?

00:49:47.087 --> 00:49:48.553
Say what you will
about Proctor,

00:49:48.588 --> 00:49:50.890
but the man knows
how to throw a party.

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:53.760
There.

00:49:53.794 --> 00:49:55.795
Now that's what
a sheriff looks like.

00:50:08.807 --> 00:50:12.243
- I do solemnly swear...
- I do solemnly swear...

00:50:12.277 --> 00:50:15.045

so help me God.

00:51:22.037 --> 00:51:24.705
So help me God.

00:51:33.581 --> 00:51:35.882
Understated as usual.

00:51:35.916 --> 00:51:38.050
You just charged the man
with racketeering.

00:51:38.118 --> 00:51:41.353
Now you're at his party.
Only in Banshee.

00:51:59.037 --> 00:52:01.304
Sheriff Hood.

00:52:01.339 --> 00:52:03.606
Mr. Proctor.

00:52:03.641 --> 00:52:05.408
This is some shindig.

00:52:05.442 --> 00:52:07.843
You'll find that Banshee
is not the backwater town

00:52:07.878 --> 00:52:10.312
it sometimes pretends to be.

00:52:10.347 --> 00:52:13.347
You enjoy yourself.

00:52:14.482 --> 00:52:16.349
I'll check in on you soon.

00:52:17.251 --> 00:52:18.818
Sure.

00:52:18.852 --> 00:52:21.787
Sheriff Hood.
Gordon Hopewell.

00:52:21.821 --> 00:52:25.257
- We met at the swearing in.
- <i>The DA, right?</i>

00:52:25.291 --> 00:52:28.593
<i>Honey, come over
and meet our new sheriff.</i>

00:52:30.729 --> 00:52:32.496
Hi.

00:52:34.332 --> 00:52:36.767
Lucas Hood.
Great to meet you.

00:52:38.736 --> 00:52:41.003
Carrie?

00:52:41.037 --> 00:52:43.239
I'm sorry.
I'm not myself tonight.

00:52:43.273 --> 00:52:45.374
No?
Who are you, then?

00:52:48.944 --> 00:52:51.412
Good to meet you,
Mrs. Hopewell.

00:52:55.117 --> 00:52:57.585
I'm telling you, there's
something wrong with that guy.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:01.122
He went through the Moody boys
like they were cardboard.

00:53:01.156 --> 00:53:04.792
So you're upset that our
sheriff knows how to fight?

00:53:04.826 --> 00:53:06.894
It wasn't just
fighting, Emmett.

00:53:06.928 --> 00:53:09.028
It was fucking combat.

00:53:10.063 --> 00:53:11.697
Sheriff Hood,

00:53:11.732 --> 00:53:14.232
I'd like you to meet
Chief Benjamin Longshadow

00:53:14.267 --> 00:53:16.134
of the local Kinaho Tribe,

00:53:16.168 --> 00:53:18.803
a good friend and a great
man revered in Banshee.

00:53:18.837 --> 00:53:20.604
Good to meet you, Chief.

00:53:20.638 --> 00:53:22.639
Likewise, Sheriff Hood.

00:53:22.673 --> 00:53:25.241
My son Alex.

00:53:25.275 --> 00:53:26.542
- Hi.
- Hey, Alex.

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:30.445
When you get settled,
my tribal council

00:53:30.479 --> 00:53:32.948
wants to honor you
with a dinner.

00:53:32.983 --> 00:53:35.050
<i>On the reservation, of course.</i>

00:53:35.085 --> 00:53:37.953
Yeah, um, that sounds great.

00:53:37.988 --> 00:53:40.789
You'll--
you'll excuse me?

00:53:59.805 --> 00:54:01.773
A sheriff?

00:54:01.807 --> 00:54:03.842
Are you kidding me?

00:54:04.977 --> 00:54:07.511
They have a great health plan.

00:54:07.546 --> 00:54:10.347
Pshh, you're not gonna
need it in prison.

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:14.450
You used to have
more faith in me.

00:54:20.124 --> 00:54:21.524
Why are you doing this?

00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:23.959
You know why.

00:54:31.301 --> 00:54:33.468
Come here for a sec.

00:54:40.242 --> 00:54:41.610
I don't believe this.

00:54:41.644 --> 00:54:43.211
It's an old Sargent safe.

00:54:43.245 --> 00:54:45.847
I can't get in there, but you
could do it in your sleep.

00:54:45.881 --> 00:54:48.582
- Jesus.
- Come on, it's the least you can do.

00:54:48.617 --> 00:54:50.050
No.

00:54:50.084 --> 00:54:51.618
What you're doing, it's crazy.

00:54:51.653 --> 00:54:53.753
- If you don't end it, I will.
- Yeah?

00:54:53.788 --> 00:54:55.988
You're in no position
to blow any whistles,

00:54:56.022 --> 00:54:58.357
Mrs. Hopewell.

00:54:58.391 --> 00:55:00.525
You're insane.

00:55:17.207 --> 00:55:20.876
Honey, I'm feeling
pretty tired.

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:22.577
You're preaching to the choir.

00:55:22.612 --> 00:55:24.980
I think we've stayed
long enough.

00:55:29.051 --> 00:55:31.218
Kai, thanks for having us.

00:55:31.253 --> 00:55:32.787
Sure.

00:55:32.821 --> 00:55:34.622
Glad you stopped by.

00:55:34.656 --> 00:55:36.990
This isn't awkward at all.

00:55:39.326 --> 00:55:40.992
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:43.723
Proctor!

00:55:45.957 --> 00:55:47.691
<i>- Get here.</i>
<i>- Just stay there.</i>

00:55:50.528 --> 00:55:52.428
Get down, get down.

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:54.530
<i>Please.</i>

00:55:54.564 --> 00:55:56.966
Dutchie motherfucker!

00:56:35.366 --> 00:56:37.368
<i>Taxi!</i>

00:57:02.557 --> 00:57:04.592
Knight to rook four.

00:57:06.695 --> 00:57:08.362
Yours.

00:57:11.299 --> 00:57:13.300
Pishak to queen three.

00:57:14.268 --> 00:57:16.136
Yours.

00:57:19.173 --> 00:57:24.110
So, no documents,

00:57:24.178 --> 00:57:26.679
no software, no hardware.

00:57:28.048 --> 00:57:32.117
Everything in this
hairdresser's, burned?

00:57:32.151 --> 00:57:33.951
Yes.

00:57:36.454 --> 00:57:39.389
Queen to knight two.
Checkmate.

00:57:51.235 --> 00:57:54.236
You will find them both...

00:57:54.271 --> 00:57:56.338
quickly.
