Nah...</i>

Lukas Hood.
I've got the badge.

00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:12.016
Kai, Hood is serious game.
You better come ready.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.542
I think he knows...

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:17.211
By the time he figures out we're 
not coming back, we'll be long gone.

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:19.386
Ana.

00:00:19.387 --> 00:00:21.598
- My name is Carrie.
- I still love you.

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.838
You cooked up a tainted batch 
that killed a boy. But not just any boy.

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:27.212
State Senator Schumacher,
that's his son.

00:00:27.213 --> 00:00:28.013
<i>No!</i>

00:00:28.177 --> 00:00:31.602
It's a hard thing to see someone die.
You're gonna be okay.

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:35.060
The smartest career move you could make
would be to get the fuck out of my way.

00:02:02.702 --> 00:02:04.169
Stop.

00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:12.511
Cuff yourself to the bedpost.

00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:22.422
Don't bother.

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:47.183
You look good. Healthy.

00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:52.089
Pale, though. I think maybe
you live on the East Coast.

00:02:52.123 --> 00:02:57.427
For years I've been thinking...
"Where is she?

00:02:57.462 --> 00:03:01.598
Is she close or half the world away?

00:03:01.632 --> 00:03:05.736
Is she still nervous when it thunders?

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.773
Does she remember
our walks in Coney Island?

00:03:09.807 --> 00:03:13.243
Getting borscht from Alexa's?"

00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:24.922
They're all there, every last one.

00:03:34.534 --> 00:03:37.202
And what do you want
in exchange for this?

00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:40.072
Just let me go.

00:03:41.942 --> 00:03:46.546

<i>He did in one week

00:03:52.987 --> 00:03:56.323
True love, huh?

00:03:56.357 --> 00:03:58.992
Just take the diamonds
and consider me dead.

00:03:59.027 --> 00:04:00.894
<i>Or what?</i>

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:04.131
You've only given me
half of what I want.

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:11.471
- I want him.
- I can't do that.

00:04:11.506 --> 00:04:14.608
If you could, you would be free.

00:04:22.251 --> 00:04:24.052
Your word?

00:04:25.188 --> 00:04:27.289
My word.

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:34.863
Now...
how are you going to get away?

00:04:34.897 --> 00:04:37.232
There's something else
in the bag for you.

00:06:49.296 --> 00:06:51.130
what can you tell us

00:06:51.165 --> 00:06:53.499
What can I tell you about...
I can tell you'd better...

00:06:53.534 --> 00:06:55.735
Benjamin, this fight will
cement your credibility

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.170
with the Gaming Commission.

00:06:57.205 --> 00:06:59.406
Give me another week,
and I'll have us cleared

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.376
to break ground on the hotel.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:08.850
I must admit I had my doubts, Kai,
but you pulled it off.

00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:10.918
It's our casino.
We're putting up the purse.

00:07:10.952 --> 00:07:13.588
<i>- He was just the middleman.
- Alex, enough.</i>

00:07:13.622 --> 00:07:15.623
<i>The champ is in the
building, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

00:07:15.657 --> 00:07:17.491
<i>The champ is in the building.</i>

00:07:17.526 --> 00:07:19.627
Mr. Sanchez, Kai Proctor.

00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:21.528
- Welcome to Banshee.
- Glad to be here.

00:07:21.563 --> 00:07:24.298
This is Benjamin Longshadow.
His tribe runs the Kinaho Moon.

00:07:24.332 --> 00:07:26.600
- Chief.
- It's an honor to have you here.

00:07:26.668 --> 00:07:29.469
- Alex Longshadow.
- Oh, 'kay.

00:07:29.504 --> 00:07:31.605
Mr. Sanchez, if you
would do us the honor...

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:33.841
a few shots with the
casino in the background.

00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:37.477
- Man, of... come on, man, of course.
- Right this way.

00:07:37.512 --> 00:07:40.414
Mr. Proctor,
Douglas Dern, Damien's manager.

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:42.649
- We spoke on the phone.
- We did. Pleasure to meet you.

00:07:42.684 --> 00:07:45.853
You said the place was old.
You didn't say ancient.

00:07:45.887 --> 00:07:49.390
The Kinaho feel a powerful
connection to their past.

00:07:49.424 --> 00:07:53.094
<i>In the case of the Kinaho Moon,
a little too powerful, in my opinion.</i>

00:07:53.128 --> 00:07:54.962
I would have preferred to
have the new casino built

00:07:54.996 --> 00:08:00.234
before we hosted Mr. Sanchez,
but rest assured the money is real.

00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:03.337
Yeah, it had better be.

00:08:03.372 --> 00:08:06.074
<i>He's gonna look worse soon, I promise.</i>

00:08:07.676 --> 00:08:11.645
<i>Nice casino. Not bad.</i>

00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:15.916
<i>Not bad at all.</i>

00:08:22.824 --> 00:08:24.258
There it is, baby.

00:08:24.292 --> 00:08:27.461
<i>- That's where I do my thing.
- This way, Mr. Sanchez.</i>

00:08:31.299 --> 00:08:33.568
You don't approve.

00:08:36.405 --> 00:08:39.808
The hotel... the revenue it will
earn should be for our people.

00:08:39.842 --> 00:08:41.343
We shouldn't be including
a man like Proctor.

00:08:41.377 --> 00:08:46.181
A man like that
gets things done quickly.

00:08:46.215 --> 00:08:51.052
We're building something that will
sustain our tribe for years to come.

00:08:53.155 --> 00:08:58.259
When I go to the spirits,
I want to have seen the start of it all.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.882
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer
a hotel? It's just a quick call.

00:09:52.917 --> 00:09:54.843
I can have you in
the presidential suite.

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.554
No, no, no.
My trailer goes wherever I go.

00:09:57.588 --> 00:09:59.723
I don't like to be too
pampered before a fight.

00:09:59.757 --> 00:10:01.791
Besides, there'll be
plenty of time for that

00:10:01.826 --> 00:10:03.693
after I put Hollister's noose up there.

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:06.096
As agreed.

00:10:07.832 --> 00:10:09.733
Thank you.

00:10:12.503 --> 00:10:13.904

It's a pretty tough day for everyone.

00:11:48.134 --> 00:11:50.134
Yep.

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:56.441
Say, why don't you join
us for dinner tonight?

00:11:56.475 --> 00:11:59.310
Nothing fancy; I'm just gonna grill
out some burgers in the back yard.

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:04.816
- Oh, honey, you know...
- That sounds great. Thanks, Gordon.

00:12:05.818 --> 00:12:07.252
Why don't we say about 6:00?

00:12:07.286 --> 00:12:09.988
- Sure. See you there.
- Good.

00:12:17.329 --> 00:12:19.397
So, how do you like
your burger, Sheriff?

00:12:19.432 --> 00:12:21.566
Medium rare, thanks.

00:12:23.969 --> 00:12:26.003
- Can I see your gun?
- Yeah, sure.

00:12:26.038 --> 00:12:29.473
No. Thank you.
You don't need to see his gun.

00:12:29.507 --> 00:12:32.409
Hey, hon', why don't you
grab the Sheriff another beer?

00:12:32.443 --> 00:12:34.711
I'll get it, Mom.

00:12:34.746 --> 00:12:37.314

- Yeah.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.987
Here you go.

00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:46.556
- Thank you.
- Yep.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.961
So, Deva, how are you doing?

00:12:53.864 --> 00:12:58.868
I don't know.
I still can't believe it.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.371
Yeah. It takes some time.

00:13:03.507 --> 00:13:07.711
- Deva, honey, would you go get...
- Yeah. Hold on, Maxie.

00:13:11.883 --> 00:13:14.184
Nice and deep, bubba.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.721

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:19.990

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.602
It's been happening
since he was a toddler.

00:13:33.204 --> 00:13:37.941
- Is he... is he okay?
- He has good days and bad days.

00:13:44.316 --> 00:13:47.067
Hey, Max,
why don't you go ahead

00:13:47.068 --> 00:13:50.854
and touch the gun
just for a second?

00:13:55.393 --> 00:13:56.529
Yeah.

Aw. So how
did the arraignments go?

00:14:11.443 --> 00:14:14.512
Well, all the men you arrested
identified this guy Hanson,

00:14:14.546 --> 00:14:16.014
<i>but apparently he's long gone.</i>

00:14:16.048 --> 00:14:18.816

00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:39.370

- Great.

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:50.014
- Alone at last.
- Shut up.

00:14:53.218 --> 00:14:55.319

00:14:58.623 --> 00:15:00.191
Heavy bag workout.

00:15:01.726 --> 00:15:06.731
Mm, not unless it was a bag of bones.

00:15:13.439 --> 00:15:16.308
Ana...

00:15:16.342 --> 00:15:21.914

- Mm, no, you're different.

00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:23.349
How?

00:15:25.653 --> 00:15:28.021
You used to be kind.

00:15:33.695 --> 00:15:36.430
You know...

00:15:36.464 --> 00:15:40.367
you get locked up,
forgotten about for 15 years,

00:15:40.401 --> 00:15:41.668
see how kind you feel after that.

00:15:41.703 --> 00:15:45.205
- Now, I know you're angry, but...
- Angry?

00:15:45.239 --> 00:15:47.474
You have no fuckin' idea.

00:15:56.684 --> 00:15:58.352

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.268
<i>I'm sorry, Uncle.</i>

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:39.039
You can't begin to
understand how alone I am.

00:19:39.074 --> 00:19:41.508
I've lost count of the people I hurt,

00:19:41.543 --> 00:19:45.145
and still I hurt people every day.

00:19:47.182 --> 00:19:50.517
You have no idea what
that does to you inside.

00:19:53.121 --> 00:19:58.192
It's like a blade in your belly
that has gradually scraped you raw.

00:19:59.361 --> 00:20:01.896
I'm not buying it, Uncle.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:08.403
You have everything you've
ever wanted. You're free.

00:20:11.274 --> 00:20:14.543
Why don't you just admit
that you like being bad?

00:20:21.319 --> 00:20:27.124
Do you realize
no one else can talk to me like that?

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:32.397
You're the only person who
isn't scared of me. The only one.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.417
I'll drive you home.

00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:03.095
<i> I want to welcome
our Camp Genoa Marines</i>

00:21:03.163 --> 00:21:05.865
<i>to view a private sparring
session with the champ.</i>

00:21:05.899 --> 00:21:08.367
<i>All right, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:21:08.402 --> 00:21:11.637
<i>let me introduce a man
who needs no introduction...</i>

00:21:11.672 --> 00:21:14.340
<i>two-time cruiserweight
champion of the world,</i>

00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:16.909
<i>honorary referee for
this weekend's fight,</i>

00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:19.878
<i>Banshee's own Sugar Bates!</i>

00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:28.754
<i>Now, a special gift for Mr. Sanchez</i>

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:31.924
<i>from our sponsors at
Stark-Himmel Timepieces...</i>

00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:35.594
<i>a solid gold watch with a
one-of-a-kind diamond bezel</i>

00:21:35.629 --> 00:21:37.529
<i>designed especially for the champ.</i>

00:21:37.564 --> 00:21:40.632
<i>This is yours. Wear it well.</i>

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:43.402
You got my invitation
for the cocktail party tomorrow

00:21:43.403 --> 00:21:45.395
- and the fight on Saturday?
- I did.

00:21:45.396 --> 00:21:47.571
<i>Thank you, gentlemen.</i>

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:51.041
<i>Hey, listen, man, I wanna give
a semper fi to all my jarheads</i>

00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:53.978
<i>from Banshee's Camp Genoa, all right?</i>

00:21:54.012 --> 00:21:56.880
Seems like you're always
hosting something around here.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.551
<i>Y'all ready to see me whip some ass?</i>

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:02.486
<i>- Yeah!
- Yeah!</i>

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:04.622
You just came in to see him train?

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:07.291
No. Actually, I came to see you.

00:22:08.794 --> 00:22:11.962
You heard about the
Schumacher boy OD'ing, right?

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:16.901
Yeah, I did. It's terrible.

00:22:19.405 --> 00:22:24.142
Proctor, you told me you had a talent
for resolving problems here in Banshee.

00:22:26.379 --> 00:22:29.080
I was kind of hoping you
could help me with this one.

00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:33.352
I found these
in the dead boy's pocket.

00:22:34.454 --> 00:22:39.224
The kids call them "skulls."
You ever seen pills like that before?

00:22:39.258 --> 00:22:41.693
Are you asking me or accusing me?

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:44.329
Why, I'm asking you, Kai.

00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:47.165
Just don't play games with me, Sheriff.

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:49.033
I'm well aware of
Mayor Kendall's agenda.

00:22:49.068 --> 00:22:50.801
Oh, this has nothing to do with Kendall.

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:53.337
The boy means well, but he's an idiot.

00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:58.108
On that at least I'm sure we can agree.
So if you'll excuse me...

00:22:59.911 --> 00:23:02.345
I'm busy trying to bring
good things to Banshee.

00:23:04.081 --> 00:23:05.914
Thanks for your time.

00:23:20.563 --> 00:23:23.264
- Asshole.
- What?

00:23:23.299 --> 00:23:25.767
You gotta watch me.
If you blink, it's over.

00:23:25.801 --> 00:23:29.070
He didn't have to hit him that
hard. They're just sparring.

00:23:32.341 --> 00:23:34.476
<i> Damn, I'm out of partners.</i>

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.611
<i> Right here!
Sarge will take you on!</i>

00:23:39.015 --> 00:23:40.815
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:44.886
Ahem. 5-0.
Yeah, Sheriff.

00:23:46.088 --> 00:23:47.822
You want a shot at the title?

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.961
Huh?
You can't throw a few punches?

00:24:00.103 --> 00:24:03.171
Go easy on him.
I'd be scared of me, too.

00:24:03.205 --> 00:24:05.306
<i> You're the champ!</i>

00:24:05.341 --> 00:24:06.574
<i> The Sheriff too smart.</i>

00:24:06.609 --> 00:24:09.911
He don't wanna step in the ring.
He don't want none of this.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.285
Excuse me, excuse me.

00:24:17.319 --> 00:24:18.953
<i>Hey. Can you come here?</i>

00:24:18.987 --> 00:24:20.555
Hey, hey. Hey, doll.

00:24:20.589 --> 00:24:23.090
- How you doing? What's your name?
- Chloe.

00:24:23.125 --> 00:24:25.593
Hey, um, Chloe, can you bring
me a bottle of champagne?

00:24:25.627 --> 00:24:29.296
- Sure. I'll be right back.
- No, doll.

00:24:29.331 --> 00:24:32.499
Can you bring it to my trailer?
Say, tonight around 11:00?

00:24:38.172 --> 00:24:41.274
- All right, Mr. Sanchez.
- All right, Chloe.

00:24:41.309 --> 00:24:42.843
<i>All right.</i>

00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:51.485
Come on in.

00:24:53.755 --> 00:24:57.158
Hmm.
Must be 11:00.

00:25:39.233 --> 00:25:41.568
<i>They're all there.</i>

00:25:46.174 --> 00:25:50.912
Just take them and go.
You can start a new life somewhere.

00:25:52.382 --> 00:25:55.584
You deserve that after
everything you've been through.

00:26:10.968 --> 00:26:16.139
You think you can buy me off? Huh?

00:26:16.174 --> 00:26:21.846
You listen to me.
I'm not going anywhere.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.516
So take your fuckin'
diamonds and get out.

00:26:54.879 --> 00:26:59.817
- You want a bump?
- I never have.

00:27:04.223 --> 00:27:05.857
I'll try.

00:27:07.327 --> 00:27:09.295
Yeah, fuck me harder.

00:27:10.764 --> 00:27:12.232
No, no, no, no.

00:27:12.266 --> 00:27:15.902
No, doll, no. Not like that.

00:27:15.937 --> 00:27:18.071
Like this.

00:27:23.611 --> 00:27:25.546
You like it like that?

00:27:32.653 --> 00:27:35.122
Fuck me harder!

00:27:52.773 --> 00:27:54.674
Ah, you're hurting me.

00:27:58.312 --> 00:28:01.314
No! Get off me!

00:28:01.348 --> 00:28:05.418
- Don't!
- Shut the fuck up!

00:28:12.927 --> 00:28:15.829
- Fucking bitch!
- Ah!

00:28:24.105 --> 00:28:25.606
Oh, my head!

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:38.686
We have combed the entire building,
reviewed all security footage.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:44.658
- She left absolutely nothing behind.
- But she came.

00:28:44.692 --> 00:28:48.861
She walked right into the lion's den.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.065
He has become a threat to her.

00:28:54.301 --> 00:29:00.739
He has been locked up for 15 years.
He's sick with love.

00:29:00.774 --> 00:29:06.079
He is reckless.
And rusty.

00:29:07.147 --> 00:29:09.248
He'll make a mistake.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:15.155
He already did.
He scared her.

00:29:21.863 --> 00:29:24.097
I thought this was your day off.

00:29:25.533 --> 00:29:28.301
I don't have much of a social life.

00:29:31.906 --> 00:29:37.678
Do you miss being home?
You don't really talk about it.

00:29:41.917 --> 00:29:44.552
It must be hard coming to
a new town not knowing anyone.

00:29:45.888 --> 00:29:48.956
I'm used to being alone.

00:29:53.462 --> 00:29:56.230
I'll never get used to it.

00:30:15.781 --> 00:30:17.615
- Sheriff.
- Yeah.

00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:19.283
You need to get over to the hospital.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:26.891
<i>Chloe, I'm so sorry
I have to ask these questions.</i>

00:30:28.925 --> 00:30:31.429
<i>I'm almost done, okay?</i>

00:30:31.463 --> 00:30:32.964
So you and Mr. Sanchez...

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:36.368
<i>being in bed together was consensual?</i>

00:30:37.737 --> 00:30:40.105
Until it got rough.

00:30:41.942 --> 00:30:43.877
I did something wrong
and he just...

00:30:43.911 --> 00:30:47.146
Chloe, look at me.

00:30:47.181 --> 00:30:50.383
You did nothing wrong, okay?

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.989
He kicked me
and then he punched me.

00:30:56.023 --> 00:30:58.458
I was crawling.
I was trying to get away,

00:30:58.493 --> 00:31:01.094
<i>but he...
he wouldn't let...</i>

00:31:01.128 --> 00:31:05.732
then he...
took the champagne bottle...

00:31:08.836 --> 00:31:10.537
<i> Okay.</i>

00:31:11.706 --> 00:31:14.274
I'm gonna go talk to your nurse, okay?

00:31:39.967 --> 00:31:42.369
Hey, hey, hey.
We've got nothing.

00:31:42.403 --> 00:31:44.405
Even the overflow lot is filled.

00:31:44.439 --> 00:31:47.541
You're gonna wanna
try down the way... hey!

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.514
Found a spot.

00:32:08.998 --> 00:32:11.266
Oh, crap.

00:32:13.802 --> 00:32:15.736
Sheriff Hood.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.008
I've heard about the girl.
How is she?

00:32:21.043 --> 00:32:23.511
Well, she looks like
she was hit by a train.

00:32:23.545 --> 00:32:25.513
I know this is a delicate situation,

00:32:25.547 --> 00:32:27.949
but I'm going to ask you
to arrest Sanchez

00:32:27.983 --> 00:32:29.417
after the fight tomorrow night.

00:32:29.451 --> 00:32:31.653
- What?
- Yeah, I know how it sounds,

00:32:31.687 --> 00:32:34.623
but Banshee
needs this fight to happen.

00:32:34.657 --> 00:32:37.081
Too many people and businesses
stand to lose if it doesn't.

00:32:37.082 --> 00:32:38.836
Are you out of your mind?!
That girl...

00:32:38.837 --> 00:32:40.362
Hey, hey, Deputy, give us a minute.

00:32:40.397 --> 00:32:42.097
- You're actually gonna discuss this...
- Hey, hey, hey.

00:32:42.132 --> 00:32:44.099
- You saw what he did to that girl.
- Calm down right now.

00:32:44.134 --> 00:32:47.570
Are you just another one of
Proctor's yes-men now? Is that it?

00:32:47.604 --> 00:32:50.440
"Meet the new boss,
same as the old boss."

00:32:54.212 --> 00:32:59.116
Sheriff, I just wanted to thank you
for your discretion.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.017
These things can always be handled.

00:33:01.051 --> 00:33:04.654
"These things"?
So this has happened before?

00:33:04.688 --> 00:33:07.823
You know the deal...
tomorrow I'll go visit the girl.

00:33:07.858 --> 00:33:10.125
She'll put on a show, but ultimately,

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.294
it always comes down to the
number they had in their mind

00:33:12.328 --> 00:33:13.929
from the moment they
decided to fuck him.

00:33:13.963 --> 00:33:16.064
- Yeah? Dern, right?
- Yeah.

00:33:16.099 --> 00:33:19.401
Yeah, you need to go somewhere
I can't see you and stay there.

00:33:19.435 --> 00:33:22.069
Hey, I mean, come on...

00:33:22.104 --> 00:33:25.506
- Hood.
- Hey, hey.

00:33:35.452 --> 00:33:36.819
5-0, that was not cool.

00:33:36.853 --> 00:33:38.921
Benny was just doing his
job, man. What the fuck?

00:33:38.955 --> 00:33:42.424
You're under arrest
for rape and aggravated assault.

00:33:45.262 --> 00:33:47.864
I'm under arrest?

00:33:51.301 --> 00:33:56.005
Okay. Yeah, I'm under arrest.
All right, yeah.

00:33:56.039 --> 00:33:57.873
Come and get me.

00:34:02.813 --> 00:34:05.081
Sheriff.

00:34:10.255 --> 00:34:11.822
Sheriff.

00:34:17.663 --> 00:34:20.798
Gotta watch me.

00:34:20.833 --> 00:34:24.435
That is cute. I like that.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:27.771
Looks like you're not
too smart after all.

00:34:28.773 --> 00:34:32.409
This what you wanna do?

00:34:32.444 --> 00:34:35.278
Ladies and gentlemen, amateur hour.

00:34:35.346 --> 00:34:37.915
Let's go.

00:35:07.946 --> 00:35:10.181
<i> Come on, Sheriff, let's go.</i>

00:35:24.564 --> 00:35:26.665
Get up, bitch!

00:35:35.408 --> 00:35:38.377
Get out of my way. Move! Move.

00:35:38.445 --> 00:35:40.246
Hood.

00:36:04.669 --> 00:36:06.837
Get the fuck off of me.

00:36:08.939 --> 00:36:11.140
Come on, Champ.

00:36:53.215 --> 00:36:55.283
Fuck.

00:36:56.552 --> 00:37:00.689
You like hitting little girls?
Huh?

00:37:14.238 --> 00:37:16.739
You motherfucker!

00:37:27.485 --> 00:37:29.786
Oh. my God!

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.674
<i> Hood, enough!</i>

00:38:49.765 --> 00:38:52.167
Meet the new boss.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.474
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

00:38:59.509 --> 00:39:02.377
<i>Anything you say or do can and
will be held against you in...</i>

00:39:04.613 --> 00:39:09.818
<i>Sugar here. Come on.
I got you.</i>

00:39:09.852 --> 00:39:15.390
<i>All right.
Let's walk, hmm? All right.</i>

00:39:15.424 --> 00:39:16.924
So you're just the kind of guy

00:39:16.959 --> 00:39:19.327
who makes friends wherever he goes, huh?

00:39:19.361 --> 00:39:21.695
Yeah, it's all right.

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:31.305
- Shit.
- Just open the door.

00:39:44.385 --> 00:39:48.756
Whoa. I always wanted
to drive one of these.

00:39:52.527 --> 00:39:55.463
You cost me a referee
gig tonight, brother.

00:39:55.498 --> 00:39:58.433
And I could have used the scratch.

00:40:09.981 --> 00:40:14.819
Ha. All righty.
Here we go.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.941
<i>♪ Wait ♪</i>

00:40:38.511 --> 00:40:41.847
<i>♪ Take all this pain ♪</i>

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.519
<i>♪ Take it away ♪</i>

00:40:50.523 --> 00:40:53.960
<i>♪ Take it away... ♪</i>

00:41:29.797 --> 00:41:32.499
- What's going on, Kai?
- He in there?

00:41:32.533 --> 00:41:36.770
<i>Yeah, but he's not fit for a visit.</i>

00:41:36.804 --> 00:41:38.372
<i> So now you're his gatekeeper?</i>

00:41:38.439 --> 00:41:41.375
It's okay, Sugar.

00:41:47.816 --> 00:41:49.951
It's all right.

00:41:49.985 --> 00:41:52.487
You cost a lot of people
a lot of money tonight.

00:41:52.522 --> 00:41:54.690
You cost me a lot of money tonight.

00:41:56.026 --> 00:41:58.193
Why don't you take it up with Sanchez?

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.403
Can I help you with
something, Mr. Proctor?

00:42:09.973 --> 00:42:13.543
I always had very good
relations with your predecessors.

00:42:13.577 --> 00:42:16.079
Yeah, you bought them.

00:42:17.848 --> 00:42:21.684
Sometimes laws need to be bent
or broken for the greater good.

00:42:21.718 --> 00:42:23.686
I know you agree with that.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.589
No. No,
you know nothing about me.

00:42:26.623 --> 00:42:30.259
Well, clearly not as much as I should.

00:42:30.294 --> 00:42:32.328
There's a lot you don't know as well.

00:42:32.362 --> 00:42:36.366
My family's been here for 160 years.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:41.171
I've lived here my entire life.
I am this town.

00:42:41.205 --> 00:42:44.507
I helped build it and I bled for it.

00:42:45.776 --> 00:42:47.977
Have you ever loved anything like that?

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:52.248
I have.

00:42:57.654 --> 00:43:00.923
You see, people here
don't always approve

00:43:00.957 --> 00:43:02.624
of the way I go about things.

00:43:02.659 --> 00:43:05.694
But from what I've
seen since you got here,

00:43:05.728 --> 00:43:07.863
you're not very different
from me in that regard.

00:43:07.897 --> 00:43:12.199
So what puzzles me is why you
seem to hold me in such contempt.

00:43:14.536 --> 00:43:18.506
I have no contempt for you.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:23.845
I'm just not afraid of you.
I think maybe you're not used to that.

00:43:24.913 --> 00:43:28.049
See, you call yourself a businessman

00:43:28.084 --> 00:43:30.418
and you dress well, you speak well,

00:43:30.453 --> 00:43:33.488
but you're still
nothing but a petty thug.

00:43:33.523 --> 00:43:36.659
You've been doing it so long,
you actually think it makes sense

00:43:36.693 --> 00:43:38.660
to show up here in
the middle of the night

00:43:38.695 --> 00:43:42.198
and ask me why you can't own
me like you own everyone else.

00:43:43.233 --> 00:43:50.206
That makes you delusional,
which makes you dangerous.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.609
Why would I want to get
in bed with someone like that?

00:43:56.146 --> 00:44:01.217
Sheriff, do you know
why they're afraid of me?

00:44:01.251 --> 00:44:04.020
Why is that?

00:44:05.255 --> 00:44:07.990
Because they should be.

00:44:12.964 --> 00:44:15.332
And maybe you should be, too.

00:44:15.366 --> 00:44:20.370
Why don't you show me why right now?

00:44:24.175 --> 00:44:29.579
Nah.
I haven't given up on you just yet.

00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:36.586
You have a good night.

00:44:40.791 --> 00:44:43.626
<i>You're not
understanding me. He's done.</i>

00:44:43.661 --> 00:44:47.063
He's done permanently!

00:44:47.097 --> 00:44:50.299
The Sheriff fucked him up really bad.

00:44:50.334 --> 00:44:53.636
I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't seen it myself.

00:44:54.872 --> 00:44:57.507
No, look, look.
They already arrested him.

00:44:57.542 --> 00:44:59.109
I'm cutting my fuckin' losses.

00:44:59.143 --> 00:45:01.812
I never should've come
to this jerkwater town.

00:45:01.846 --> 00:45:03.213
I gotta call you back.

00:45:03.248 --> 00:45:05.916
- Mr. Dern.
- I'm a little busy here.

00:45:05.984 --> 00:45:07.985
I imagine so.
I won't waste your time.

00:45:08.019 --> 00:45:12.256
- I'm here to pick up the satchel.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

00:45:13.525 --> 00:45:15.058
You were paid an
agreed-upon sum of cash

00:45:15.093 --> 00:45:16.993
to deliver the fight to the Kinaho Moon.

00:45:17.028 --> 00:45:20.563
Clearly, the fight is off.
And while Mr. Proctor does not hold

00:45:20.598 --> 00:45:24.767
Mr. Sanchez's reckless
behavior against you personally,

00:45:24.801 --> 00:45:27.770
he does expect his money
to be returned.

00:45:32.542 --> 00:45:35.810
Well, listen to me, little man.

00:45:35.845 --> 00:45:38.312
Proctor assured me that
he'd buy us enough time

00:45:38.347 --> 00:45:41.683
to pay off that little skank, so
he's the one that didn't come through.

00:45:41.717 --> 00:45:45.553
And as far as the money, tell him
it's the cost of doing business.

00:45:45.587 --> 00:45:49.857
And if he knows what's good
for him, he'll leave it at that.

00:45:49.892 --> 00:45:51.459
Now I'm gonna go finish packing...

00:45:51.493 --> 00:45:54.929
so I can get the fuck out
of this shithole!

00:46:18.854 --> 00:46:20.655
<i>Hey, what are
you doing here, asshole?</i>

00:46:20.689 --> 00:46:24.058
<i>I told you...
what the fuck is that?</i>

00:46:24.092 --> 00:46:26.727
<i>Hey, wait. Now, now, don't.
Come on. Just back off.</i>

00:46:26.761 --> 00:46:29.697
<i>Hey...</i>

00:46:29.731 --> 00:46:34.034
<i>Don't!</i>
