00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:33.730
There you go.

00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:39.570
All resolute colonists, please proceed
to your assigned Jupiter pods.

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:41.200
Thank you for remaining calm.

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.280
There's always room for
a mechanic or two.

00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:46.490
Great.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.540
What about the rest
of your family?

00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:51.750
- They won't be coming.
- Oh.

00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:53.630
Sorry, miss...

00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:55.590
Doctor.

00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:58.670
Dr. Smith.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.760
