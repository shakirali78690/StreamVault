WEBVTT

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.176
Come on!

00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:10.478
Hey, hey!
Stick to the trees.

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.381
Right there
on the ground!

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:18.719
Run!

00:00:20.588 --> 00:00:22.690
Baby!

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.743
I think he knows.

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:21.048
No, he doesn't know.
He can't.

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.817
By the time he figures out
we're not coming back,

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.254
we'll be long gone.

00:01:34.462 --> 00:01:36.464
Hey.

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.269
We risk our lives
every time we steal for him.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.038
Why not risk
our lives for us?

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:48.509
No one's ever
stolen from Rabbit.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.380
He doesn't know.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.593
Everything will be fine.

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.947
Are we back
on track, Mr. Hanson?

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:34.948
catch-upill playing

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.484
after that
power failure yesterday,

00:03:36.584 --> 00:03:39.420
but I'll keep them late and we
should be caught up by Sunday.

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:42.856
Friday.

00:03:44.592 --> 00:03:47.628
Okay. Friday.
I'm on it.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.567
Oh, I'm on it,
motherfucker.

00:04:26.334 --> 00:04:28.769
Get down here.

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:46.153
You know for a fact
the Yoders are out of town?

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:48.155
Yeah.
Away till Tuesday.

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:50.558
Okay.

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:04.938
Get out of here.

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:13.514
Good to go, boys.
All right.

00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:15.649
It's an original
masonry house.

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.050
All the houses
in this neighborhood

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.853
came up
in the late 1920s.

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:21.855
If you wanted to paint
over this green in here.

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:25.092
But I'll be here...
Excuse me just a moment.

00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:26.927
Mrs. Hopewell,
good morning.

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:28.496
What are you doing here?

00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:30.998
Same as everyone else.

00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:33.534
I'm looking
to put down roots.

00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:36.470
This room has great
morning light.

00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:39.673
Would you like
to see the kitchen?

00:05:39.773 --> 00:05:41.675
Sure.

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:45.946
What the fuck
are you doing?

00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:05.165
You've been training.
What the fuck are you doing?

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:06.867
This is my life.

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:09.269
Ana.
My name is Carrie.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.440
Either way,
I still love you.

00:06:16.143 --> 00:06:19.880
If that's true, then you'll
leave here and never come back.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.451
Carrie?

00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:27.888
Um, your phone.

00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:31.024
Shit! Okay.
Hello?

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:35.062
Nice kitchen.

00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:37.631
Mrs. Hopewell,
this is Principal Merrick.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:38.966
I'm calling to let you know

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:40.568
that Deva is not in school
again this morning.

00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:42.936
I wanted to check
if she was feeling ill.

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:44.872
No, no, she's not,

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:46.740
but I can assure you
she's going to be.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.409
I hope she's okay.
Please let us know. Thanks.

00:06:57.384 --> 00:06:59.386
Hey, it's Deva.
Leave a message.

00:06:59.487 --> 00:07:01.321
Or don't.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.856
Deva, where are you?

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:06.560
♪ You're so, so fine

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.631
♪ Even when you're dropping,
you're down like a man ♪

00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:15.569
♪ I know you're just a boy,
but I could hardly tell ♪

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:18.038
♪ And no one
really cares. ♪

00:07:21.308 --> 00:07:23.611
Whoo!

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:40.894
How's it going?

00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:57.711
Yo, man. Are we putting
the Skulls with these?

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.413
Just sort it and show
me.
Reed?

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.554
Hey, Hanson.
Hey, Reed.

00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:08.121
Who the fuck are they?

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.757
It's okay.
They're cool.

00:08:09.857 --> 00:08:11.959
Move.

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:18.231
Well, come here,
cool girls.

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:37.685
Go on.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.870
You ask and Arno delivers.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.772
The Red Skull stamp
as promised.

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:01.541
Pretty sweet, huh?

00:09:01.642 --> 00:09:03.143
Now if we can just
settle up our account...

00:09:03.243 --> 00:09:04.845
Hey.
Ah! Ow, man!

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:07.547
Hey, fuckhead, you got high
while you're working for me?

00:09:07.648 --> 00:09:10.651
Are you fucking crazy?
No way, man. I'm a professional.

00:09:10.751 --> 00:09:12.419
So you're not
tripping right now?

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:14.421
I'm straight, man.

00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:16.824
Look at me.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.398
Fucking tweaker.
Get him out of here.

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:27.901
Move it.

00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:30.237
Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'm gonna kick your ass.

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:32.973
Fuck you.
Yo, chill out, man.
Get off of me.

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:35.342
Fuck off! Go!

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:42.950
Come here.

00:09:46.987 --> 00:09:48.756
Come here.

00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:43.176
Are you cool?

00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:51.084
What is it?

00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:53.721
Some of the pills
aren't pure.

00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:55.555
There's caffeine in them.
You know what?

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.290
How about you leave
the chemistry to me

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.893
and just go back
and make the fucking pills?

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:10.971
What's going on?

00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:21.982
You're in.

00:11:26.887 --> 00:11:28.856
Midnight tomorrow
at Yoder's barn.

00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:31.992
You know it?
Yeah.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.663
And you girls will
spread the word, right?

00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:39.366
Hells yeah, we will.

00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:43.370
Let's go, Deva.

00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:54.247
Hey.
Sheriff.

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:57.785
You're late.

00:11:57.885 --> 00:11:59.519
What, do I need
a note from home?

00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:00.788
Couldn't reach you
on your radio.

00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:02.655
I'm here now.
What do you need?

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:03.957
What I need,
what we need,

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.525
is a sheriff
that answers his radio.

00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:07.727
All right?

00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:09.162
I'll take that
under advisement.

00:12:09.262 --> 00:12:11.464
Look, I don't know how
you did things in Oregon...

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.633
Shut up, Brock.
What?

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:17.504
What the hell did you just say
to me?
I won't tell you twice.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.749
Mr. Proctor.

00:12:31.551 --> 00:12:33.486
There he is.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.522
That looks painful.

00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:36.723
I'll survive.

00:12:36.824 --> 00:12:39.492
May I have a word
in private?

00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:53.106
Kobe steaks.
My best.

00:12:53.206 --> 00:12:54.641
Thank you.

00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:56.743
Well, you saved my life.

00:12:56.844 --> 00:12:58.979
I was just
doing my job.

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:03.884
I'm sure by now you've
gleaned that there are people

00:13:03.984 --> 00:13:06.286
in Banshee,
our young mayor among them,

00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:08.989
who would have been happy
to see me go down.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:11.724
Yeah, why is that?

00:13:11.825 --> 00:13:13.460
Oh...

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.529
some people find my business
practices a little aggressive.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.731
I don't deny it.

00:13:18.832 --> 00:13:20.800
Not everyone shares
my vision for this town.

00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:23.270
But that's a talk
for another time.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.271
The reason I stopped in

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:28.108
is to warn you about
the Moody brothers.

00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:29.642
Warn me?

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:30.878
swimmingey might be

00:13:30.978 --> 00:13:32.846
in the shallow
end of the gene pool,

00:13:32.946 --> 00:13:35.082
but they're a fiercely
loyal clan.

00:13:35.182 --> 00:13:37.650
Been in this town
almost as long as my people.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.252
And they will
be out for blood.

00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:42.923
I'll keep my eye out.

00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:46.393
Sheriff, I wouldn't
be bothering you

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:49.496
if I didn't think you have a
serious problem on your hands.

00:13:49.596 --> 00:13:51.064
I don't deny
your abilities.

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:54.367
It's just that your hands
are tied by this office,

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:58.038
whereas I have a talent
for resolving problems

00:13:58.138 --> 00:14:00.473
like this one quietly.

00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:07.047
I appreciate your concern,

00:14:07.147 --> 00:14:09.816
but...

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:13.020
I think I'll just take
things as they come.

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:18.591
It could be that I'm speaking
globally here, Sheriff,

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:21.161
beyond the Moody situation.

00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:24.364
You see, I've got a good number
of local business interests

00:14:24.464 --> 00:14:27.067
that need to be kept
running smoothly.

00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:30.270
These interests can occasionally
generate difficulties,

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.341
but they also
generate revenues.

00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:36.576
Significant revenues.

00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:40.948
What do you want,
Mr. Proctor?

00:14:42.315 --> 00:14:45.585
I might ask you the same
question, Sheriff Hood.

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:54.127
I'm good.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.532
But thank you.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.908
You take care of that.

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:12.445
It could go bad
pretty fast.

00:15:49.516 --> 00:15:51.718
- Where's my fucking money?
- You'll get it.

00:15:51.818 --> 00:15:54.387
Where'd you land?
In hell.

00:15:54.487 --> 00:15:57.657
Do you have any idea
what I'm surrounded by?

00:15:57.757 --> 00:15:59.792
Skee-fucking-Ball,

00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:01.494
cotton-fucking-candy,

00:16:01.594 --> 00:16:03.930
and sea-fucking-gulls.

00:16:04.031 --> 00:16:07.000
Is that a cape?

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.470
This is Diane von
Furstenberg, chica.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.305
Shoo.
Go get pregnant.

00:16:14.574 --> 00:16:17.444
So?
Bitch,
you got lucky on this one.

00:16:17.544 --> 00:16:21.614
Lucas Hood had virtually
no living relatives,

00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:24.084
an estranged ex-wife
and son he ain't seen in years.

00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:26.353
I couldn't even find
any close friends.

00:16:26.453 --> 00:16:28.088
And he ain't into
the grid, neither.

00:16:28.188 --> 00:16:30.057
No Facebook, no Twitter.

00:16:30.157 --> 00:16:32.559
Your cover
is good for now.

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:34.727
Except...

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.229
Except what?

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:37.997
Except that being
where you are

00:16:38.098 --> 00:16:40.933
makes you the dumbest
bitch that I know!

00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:43.170
Oh, not you, Snooki.

00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:50.710
So, how's she look?

00:16:53.613 --> 00:16:55.682
She looks good.

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:48.368
Hold it!

00:17:49.602 --> 00:17:52.205
Sorry, it's been
that kind of week.

00:17:52.305 --> 00:17:54.707
You okay?
Yeah.

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:56.643
Then let's have some fun.

00:18:08.388 --> 00:18:10.890
You and your
Hula Poppers.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.060
If you're after serious game,
you'd better come ready.

00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:15.662
Live bait is the way to go.

00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:18.798
Nah. I've been winning
fishing derbies

00:18:18.898 --> 00:18:21.568
since you were
a speck of sperm.

00:18:21.668 --> 00:18:25.272
I hear you have the new sheriff
living over your garage.

00:18:26.873 --> 00:18:31.110
Huh? Seems kind of strange for
an ex-con renting to a lawman.

00:18:32.712 --> 00:18:35.081
Doesn't it bother you?

00:18:35.182 --> 00:18:38.685
Apparently not as much
as it bothers you.

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:42.655
At some point, I might begin
to question your loyalty.

00:18:44.324 --> 00:18:48.261
No, I'm just
a broken-down ex-con.

00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:51.431
I don't choose sides.

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:56.469
Kai.

00:18:56.569 --> 00:19:00.607
You talk about
serious game?

00:19:00.707 --> 00:19:03.310
Hood is serious game.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.345
Like you've never seen.

00:19:05.445 --> 00:19:08.881
So if you come for him,
you'd better come ready.

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.688
Take care
of yourself, Sugar.

00:19:16.756 --> 00:19:18.591
Yeah, you, too.

00:19:30.703 --> 00:19:33.840
No, no, no. You can't be
here tonight.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.842
And yet I am.

00:19:35.942 --> 00:19:37.377
Cole Moody's wake.

00:19:37.477 --> 00:19:40.046
His brothers
are drunker than usual,

00:19:40.146 --> 00:19:41.548
if that's possible.

00:19:41.648 --> 00:19:43.082
Now, we've already
had two fistfights.

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:44.984
That's just between
family members.

00:19:45.084 --> 00:19:47.186
Can I at least get a
sandwich? Hey.

00:19:47.287 --> 00:19:49.256
All right.

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:51.491
All right, just...

00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:56.028
Whatever it takes
to get you out of here.

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:57.664
Look, here.
Come on, take 'em.

00:19:57.764 --> 00:20:00.900
Come on, eat 'em. Plenty more
where that came from.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.869
Come on.

00:20:02.969 --> 00:20:05.204
All right?

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.436
Sheriff Hood.

00:20:36.536 --> 00:20:38.438
Yeah?

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:43.175
You don't know
who I am, do you?

00:20:43.276 --> 00:20:44.944
Not yet.

00:20:45.044 --> 00:20:47.380
I'm Kat Moody.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.115
You killed my husband.

00:20:49.215 --> 00:20:52.151
And now you're
sitting here eating food

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:55.355
prepared for his wake,
food that I paid for.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.960
Well, I apologize
about the food.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.596
That was in bad taste.

00:21:03.696 --> 00:21:06.699
But not for killing
my husband?

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:12.805
He smashed me
in the head with a pipe

00:21:12.905 --> 00:21:15.074
and then fired a gun
at a crowded party.

00:21:15.174 --> 00:21:18.311
So, while I am sorry
for your grief...

00:21:21.381 --> 00:21:24.283
He laid a good one
on you.

00:21:24.384 --> 00:21:25.985
He did.

00:21:30.723 --> 00:21:32.692
You're the second
woman to hit me today.

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.694
I bet that's
a slow day for you.

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.896
Mmm.

00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:40.299
Jesus Christ.
Marcus, Dex, put those away.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.268
Shut up, Kat,
and get inside.

00:21:42.369 --> 00:21:46.072
You Moody boys sure do
like your six-shooters.

00:21:46.172 --> 00:21:48.140
You got permits
for those?

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.976
You won't be around
long enough to find out.

00:21:50.076 --> 00:21:51.644
You're not gonna shoot a man
at your brother's wake.

00:21:51.744 --> 00:21:53.312
What the hell
is wrong with you?

00:21:53.413 --> 00:21:55.314
We're doing this
for Cole.

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:57.384
Cole was a mean drunk
and he got what was coming.

00:21:57.484 --> 00:21:59.452
You watch your mouth, bitch.
I'll kill you, too.

00:21:59.552 --> 00:22:02.355
Hey, you're Marcus, right?
And you're Dex?

00:22:02.455 --> 00:22:03.890
That's right.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.659
Okay, Marcus, Dex,

00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:09.562
you have the right to remain
silent.
That's far enough.

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:11.464
Anything you do say can be used
against you in a court of law.

00:22:11.564 --> 00:22:12.565
You believe the balls on this
guy?

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:14.000
He thinks he's arresting us.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.135
You have the right to an
attorney.
Shut the fuck up.

00:22:16.235 --> 00:22:18.438
Why don't you make me?

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:21.374
Come on.

00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:27.179
Marcus, Dex,

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:29.148
your coffee
is getting cold.

00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:31.451
This don't
concern you, Sugar.

00:22:31.551 --> 00:22:34.220
All the same,
I am concerned.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.989
Come on.

00:22:41.828 --> 00:22:44.030
Hmm?

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.602
If you can't afford
an attorney,

00:22:49.702 --> 00:22:52.772
the court will appoint one for
you, and he'll probably suck.

00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:55.642
Sheriff Hood, they're drunk
and they're morons,

00:22:55.742 --> 00:22:58.010
but they're grieving
in their own way.

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:08.154
Get the fuck out of here.

00:23:09.756 --> 00:23:11.658
Go on.

00:23:13.793 --> 00:23:16.696
This isn't over, Hood.
We'll be looking out for you.

00:23:16.796 --> 00:23:19.499
Well, I'll be the one in the car
with the flashing lights.

00:23:26.172 --> 00:23:28.475
What the fuck
are you looking at?

00:23:36.082 --> 00:23:37.684
And you are?

00:25:41.107 --> 00:25:42.709
Let's go.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.979
Hey, stick to the trees for at
least two miles. You'll be fine.

00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:48.648
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

00:25:48.748 --> 00:25:50.516
I'm gonna throw them off.
No, I'm not leaving you!

00:25:50.617 --> 00:25:52.284
Listen to me.
You were right about Rabbit.

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:54.520
He knew. He knew.
Don't do this.

00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:56.555
Don't do this. Don't do this.
We can make it.

00:25:56.656 --> 00:25:58.424
Hey, hey!
I'll catch up to you.

00:25:58.524 --> 00:26:00.727
I love you.
I love you.

00:26:00.827 --> 00:26:02.929
Take the diamonds.

00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:05.264
I'll catch up to you.

00:26:05.364 --> 00:26:06.933
Go!

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.969
Right there!

00:26:10.069 --> 00:26:12.171
No!
I got you!

00:26:12.271 --> 00:26:13.272
Stay right where you are.

00:26:13.372 --> 00:26:15.307
Get down on
the ground right now.

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:18.344
Right there. Hands up.
Don't do it...

00:26:18.444 --> 00:26:20.346
Come on.

00:26:20.446 --> 00:26:22.649
Copy. We got him.

00:26:28.187 --> 00:26:29.922
Baby!

00:26:34.126 --> 00:26:36.262
Hey.

00:26:38.197 --> 00:26:40.132
You okay, baby?

00:26:40.232 --> 00:26:42.368
Yeah.

00:26:47.273 --> 00:26:49.375
Just a bad dream.

00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:05.658
Is that the Moody report?

00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:08.160
Yeah.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.896
It's supposed to be.

00:27:12.765 --> 00:27:14.867
But if I had known
there was all this paperwork,

00:27:14.967 --> 00:27:16.936
I never would have
shot him.

00:27:17.036 --> 00:27:19.605
Aw, come on, you must have had
to do this back in Oregon.

00:27:19.706 --> 00:27:22.875
Uh, yeah, I wasn't
any better at it then.

00:27:23.943 --> 00:27:26.578
You filled out
the incident report twice.

00:27:26.679 --> 00:27:28.881
And you have to attach it
to the SO sheet.

00:27:29.816 --> 00:27:33.385
SO?
State oversight.

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:37.323
Have you already done
the weapons discharge form?

00:27:45.264 --> 00:27:47.199
Uh, you know,

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:51.003
Sheriff Morgan used to have Alma
do all this stuff for him.

00:27:51.103 --> 00:27:53.740
She enjoys it. Just buy her a
nice bottle of wine.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.743
Look it over
when she's done.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.846
Sold.

00:28:05.985 --> 00:28:08.120
You gave us your word that
you'd stop ditching school.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.189
My grades are fine.
That is not the point.

00:28:10.289 --> 00:28:12.124
So where were you
this afternoon?

00:28:12.224 --> 00:28:14.560
What's the difference?
It's Saturday.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.463
My grades are fine, too.
Rock on, Max.

00:28:17.563 --> 00:28:18.765
Deva, this isn't a joke.

00:28:18.865 --> 00:28:20.800
Your mother and I
are worried about you.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.769
Well, there's nothing
to be worried about.

00:28:22.869 --> 00:28:25.404
Okay?
That's not
what it looks like.

00:28:25.504 --> 00:28:27.473
What...

00:28:27.573 --> 00:28:29.108
Well, that went well.

00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:32.244
I just... I can't
do this right now.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.449
Hey, we are not finished.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.685
Women, right?

00:28:39.786 --> 00:28:42.154
You little...

00:28:44.123 --> 00:28:47.760
Dad...
If you turn into
a teenager, I will kill you.

00:29:18.024 --> 00:29:20.259
Mr. Bowman.
Deputy Brock.

00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:21.760
What can we do for you?

00:29:21.861 --> 00:29:24.396
You are the new sheriff?
That's right.

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:27.399
Something is happening
at the Yoder farm tonight.

00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:28.868
Some kind of a barn party.

00:29:28.968 --> 00:29:31.003
A rave?
Yes.

00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:33.772
My son used that word.
He saw them setting it up.

00:29:33.873 --> 00:29:36.375
A rave in this town?

00:29:36.475 --> 00:29:38.610
Emmett.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.547
Yeah, thank you
for coming in.

00:29:46.185 --> 00:29:50.722
Sheriff, you'll keep my family's
name out of this?

00:29:50.823 --> 00:29:52.758
Yeah, you were
never here.

00:29:52.859 --> 00:29:55.061
Thank you.

00:29:55.161 --> 00:29:58.430
My daughter
Rebecca.

00:30:06.973 --> 00:30:09.641
Good evening.
Good evening, Sheriff Hood.

00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:11.377
Very nice to meet you.

00:30:12.945 --> 00:30:14.546
You, too.

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:17.917
Rebecca, get in.

00:30:35.401 --> 00:30:37.503
What's going on?

00:30:37.603 --> 00:30:39.005
Are we going to war?

00:30:39.105 --> 00:30:41.307
These raves are highly
organized enterprises.

00:30:41.407 --> 00:30:44.743
It's designed for the sole
purpose of selling drugs.

00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:47.813
And where there are drugs,
there will be guns.

00:30:47.914 --> 00:30:49.916
Usually by the time
we hear about it,

00:30:50.016 --> 00:30:52.318
the place is trashed
and everyone is long gone.

00:30:52.418 --> 00:30:54.453
Let's go.

00:30:54.553 --> 00:30:56.322
Right?

00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:59.391
Right.

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:04.763
Like, oh, my God.
There's so many people.

00:31:04.863 --> 00:31:06.966
We're with Hanson.
Beaty and Deva.

00:31:07.066 --> 00:31:09.168
Oh, like that's gonna help?

00:31:09.268 --> 00:31:12.838
Why don't you wait like
everybody else?
VIPs? Nice.

00:31:22.514 --> 00:31:23.715
Hey, Hanson!

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:25.251
Yeah, police band
all quiet?

00:31:25.351 --> 00:31:27.486
Okay, people,
let's get paid.

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:09.195
Hey!
You made it. Hey.

00:32:09.295 --> 00:32:11.797
What's up?
Oh, my God.

00:32:11.897 --> 00:32:14.766
Snacks, anyone?
Oh, Skulls!

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:17.303
What is it?
It's E.

00:32:40.392 --> 00:32:41.793
Whoo!

00:32:51.503 --> 00:32:53.305
Hey, baby.

00:32:53.405 --> 00:32:54.973
You okay?

00:32:55.074 --> 00:32:57.176
Yeah.
Okay.

00:33:09.855 --> 00:33:11.457
Deva.

00:33:13.459 --> 00:33:14.926
Deva.

00:33:15.027 --> 00:33:18.064
Deva!

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:23.202
Deva.

00:33:30.609 --> 00:33:34.280
♪ Psychotic, it's psychotic,
psychotic, it's psychotic ♪

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:38.217
♪ Psychotic, it's psychotic,
psychotic, it's psychotic ♪

00:33:38.317 --> 00:33:41.620
♪ Psychotic, it's psychotic,
psychotic, it's psychotic ♪

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.157
♪ Psychotic, psychotic,
psychotic... ♪

00:34:05.711 --> 00:34:07.246
So what's the plan?

00:34:07.346 --> 00:34:10.282
All right, there's only two ways
in and out of here...

00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:13.519
that front entrance and there's
a utility door around back.

00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:15.521
Should be pretty easy
for us to cover.

00:34:15.621 --> 00:34:18.557
Yeah, but God only knows how
many kids are actually in there.

00:34:18.657 --> 00:34:20.126
Start a panic,

00:34:20.226 --> 00:34:22.828
this thing could go
from bad to worse fast.

00:34:22.928 --> 00:34:24.530
What are you doing?

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.398
We need to see inside.

00:34:26.498 --> 00:34:28.367
If I can find
the guy in charge,

00:34:28.467 --> 00:34:31.670
we can shut this down
without starting a riot.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:35.040
So you're just gonna wander in
there and ask who's in charge?

00:34:35.141 --> 00:34:37.376
That's your plan?
Yeah.

00:34:37.476 --> 00:34:39.645
Oh, great.

00:34:39.745 --> 00:34:42.281
Aren't you kind of old
to pass for a teenager?

00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:43.949
I'm young at heart.

00:34:44.049 --> 00:34:45.417
Can't be out
of uniform, Hood.

00:34:45.517 --> 00:34:47.052
You are legally required
to identify yourself.

00:34:47.153 --> 00:34:48.854
Is he always
this much fun?

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:03.635
Yeah, I'm here
for the rave.

00:35:03.735 --> 00:35:06.438
There's no rave here.
Come on,
guys, what's it gonna take?

00:35:11.977 --> 00:35:14.346
Shit.
Are you kidding me?

00:35:16.248 --> 00:35:18.850
He can't... he can't
just do that, right?

00:35:24.523 --> 00:35:27.893
- He's waving.
- Yeah.

00:35:27.993 --> 00:35:29.861
What do we do?

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:40.406
Moore, what's
your count on the gate?

00:35:55.053 --> 00:35:59.157
Moore, are you hearing me?
I asked what's your count.

00:36:00.692 --> 00:36:03.195
Moore, what the fuck?
Respond.

00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:07.766
Someone get me
eyes on Moore.

00:36:17.943 --> 00:36:19.845
Someone get me
eyes on Moore.

00:36:19.945 --> 00:36:21.513
You got nothing?

00:36:33.259 --> 00:36:34.960
Hey, it's Deva.
Leave a message.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.596
Or don't.

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:05.491
Reed? Reed.

00:37:05.591 --> 00:37:07.959
What is it?

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:10.362
Reed! Reed!

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.904
Help!
Somebody help me!

00:37:26.778 --> 00:37:28.013
Reed!

00:37:28.113 --> 00:37:29.080
Somebody...

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.616
Help!

00:37:30.716 --> 00:37:32.818
Please!

00:37:45.764 --> 00:37:47.566
Help!

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.105
Something's wrong. Call the
paramedics and get in here.

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:56.342
We've got to shut
this down fast.

00:38:02.381 --> 00:38:05.317
Everyone clear out.
It's going south.

00:38:07.085 --> 00:38:08.987
Five-O, move out now!

00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:15.361
Somebody help!
Help!

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.367
Help!

00:38:22.334 --> 00:38:25.003
Somebody help me.
Hey, hey, hey.

00:38:25.103 --> 00:38:27.706
Come on.
Come on.

00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:29.775
Move!

00:38:33.412 --> 00:38:36.047
Look at me. Look at me.
You okay?

00:38:36.147 --> 00:38:38.617
Are you okay?

00:38:38.717 --> 00:38:41.453
Are you okay? Deva?

00:38:43.889 --> 00:38:46.525
This is the BSD.

00:38:46.625 --> 00:38:49.260
Please start exiting
in an orderly fashion.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.836
You stay here.
Do not move.

00:38:57.936 --> 00:38:59.471
Stay there.

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:02.774
Get out! Get out!
Get out.

00:39:45.851 --> 00:39:47.819
Hey!

00:40:28.193 --> 00:40:30.829
You good?

00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:33.031
I'm good.

00:40:36.535 --> 00:40:38.203
- Is it charged?
- Charged.

00:40:39.838 --> 00:40:41.473
- Anything?
- No.

00:40:41.573 --> 00:40:43.341
- All right.
- Ready? Charge.

00:40:46.778 --> 00:40:49.080
No.
All right, we gotta call it.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.716
No. No!

00:40:50.816 --> 00:40:54.252
No! Oh, no!

00:40:54.352 --> 00:40:57.422
Reed! No!

00:40:57.523 --> 00:41:00.592
Oh, my God!
Shh. It's okay.

00:41:00.692 --> 00:41:03.028
Oh, my God.

00:41:03.128 --> 00:41:06.064
Shh.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.647
Sit tight.
Turn around.

00:41:23.515 --> 00:41:26.484
Look at this.
Reed Schumacher.

00:41:26.585 --> 00:41:30.021
State Senator Schumacher,
that's his son.

00:41:34.192 --> 00:41:36.361
What the fuck are you
looking at, bitch?

00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:38.930
Hey, shut your mouth.

00:41:44.936 --> 00:41:46.304
I asked you
a question, bitch.

00:41:46.404 --> 00:41:47.338
What the fuck
are you looking at?

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:51.209
Sheriff! Sheriff!
Hood!

00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:52.978
Get the fuck off me.

00:41:56.882 --> 00:41:58.650
Come on, I'll take
you both home.

00:42:12.463 --> 00:42:14.232
Hood, hey,
what the fuck was that?

00:42:14.332 --> 00:42:15.533
Hey, leave it, Brock.

00:42:15.634 --> 00:42:17.535
You just beat the shit
out of a handcuffed perp

00:42:17.636 --> 00:42:19.571
in front of 10 witnesses.
He had it coming.

00:42:19.671 --> 00:42:21.139
I don't know how
you did things out West,

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:24.209
but you cannot keep making up
the rules as you go along here.

00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:27.579
You're putting the rest of us
in an impossible position.

00:42:29.047 --> 00:42:30.148
Get in.

00:42:30.248 --> 00:42:32.083
And what the hell
am I supposed to do, huh?

00:42:32.183 --> 00:42:34.485
You know what?

00:42:34.586 --> 00:42:36.655
I'd seriously
consider resigning.

00:42:36.755 --> 00:42:38.590
Yeah?
Yeah.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.792
You know what, Sheriff?

00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:41.993
I was here long before you,

00:42:42.093 --> 00:42:43.595
and I'm gonna be here long
after you're gone,

00:42:43.695 --> 00:42:45.563
which by the looks of it,
is gonna be pretty damn soon.

00:42:45.664 --> 00:42:47.265
Maybe.
Mm-hmm.

00:42:47.365 --> 00:42:49.400
But right now

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.737
the smartest career move
you could make

00:42:51.837 --> 00:42:54.840
would be to get
the fuck out of my way.

00:43:32.277 --> 00:43:34.379
Wait!

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:42.487
What...

00:43:42.587 --> 00:43:46.391
You cut my fucking
finger off.

00:43:46.491 --> 00:43:47.859
Our ecstasy trade
generates revenues

00:43:47.959 --> 00:43:49.728
of a quarter of
a million dollars a week

00:43:49.828 --> 00:43:51.863
in Philadelphia
and DC.

00:43:51.963 --> 00:43:53.865
I spent years
and serious money

00:43:53.965 --> 00:43:55.500
developing that network.

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.502
And because I'm not
a fucking idiot,

00:43:57.602 --> 00:43:59.871
I never sold a single pill
in this county.

00:43:59.971 --> 00:44:02.440
I don't shit where
I sleep, Mr. Hanson.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.943
You, on the other hand,
have just taken a steaming dump

00:44:05.043 --> 00:44:06.611
right in the middle
of my fucking bed.

00:44:06.712 --> 00:44:08.146
You stole my Skulls,

00:44:08.246 --> 00:44:10.348
you cooked up a tainted
batch that killed a boy.

00:44:10.448 --> 00:44:11.950
But not just any boy.

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:15.586
The boy of a state senator.
Do you understand?

00:44:15.687 --> 00:44:17.388
You've unleashed
a shitstorm on me.

00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:19.725
I'm sorry, Mr. Proctor.

00:44:23.094 --> 00:44:25.764
Now...

00:44:25.864 --> 00:44:28.867
I want you to look
over here at Preacher.

00:44:28.967 --> 00:44:31.436
Preacher now has
a taste for you.

00:44:33.338 --> 00:44:35.440
I'll give you 60 seconds.

00:44:37.743 --> 00:44:41.112
What?
Are you fucking serious?

00:44:41.212 --> 00:44:43.314
Starting now.

00:44:49.154 --> 00:44:51.289
Fass!

00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:05.937
Please!

00:45:51.749 --> 00:45:54.219
It's a hard thing
to see someone die.

00:46:01.659 --> 00:46:05.931
First time,
I was younger than you.

00:46:07.632 --> 00:46:10.268
A kid from my neighborhood

00:46:10.368 --> 00:46:12.303
tried to run across
the railroad tracks.

00:46:13.738 --> 00:46:18.543
He tripped on
some gravel and...

00:46:18.643 --> 00:46:21.512
you know.

00:46:26.251 --> 00:46:28.653
Thing is,

00:46:28.753 --> 00:46:31.522
you can't make
sense out of it.

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:33.925
All right?

00:46:35.426 --> 00:46:37.929
It doesn't make sense.

00:46:40.431 --> 00:46:42.400
You hear me?

00:46:44.702 --> 00:46:46.938
You just...

00:46:49.407 --> 00:46:51.742
I don't know.

00:46:51.843 --> 00:46:54.946
You accept it
at some point.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:07.658
Was he a friend
of yours?

00:47:07.758 --> 00:47:10.061
The kid
on the tracks?

00:47:12.797 --> 00:47:14.933
No.

00:47:17.135 --> 00:47:20.105
No, he was just some asshole
from the neighborhood.

00:47:22.073 --> 00:47:25.376
And I was an asshole who dared
him to beat the 5:15 Amtrak.

00:47:29.614 --> 00:47:32.417
Now you listen to me.
Hey.

00:47:36.721 --> 00:47:39.124
